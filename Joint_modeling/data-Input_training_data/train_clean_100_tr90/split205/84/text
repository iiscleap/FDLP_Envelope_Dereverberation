3526-176651-0007 BEYOND THE BLUE SMOKE DRIFTING IN THE VALLEY THOSE LIMITLESS BLUE WAVES MUST RUN UNDER THE SUN ON AND ON TO THE END OF THE WORLD HER DEAD SISTER HAD GONE INTO THAT FAR SILENCE
3526-176651-0008 AND HAD BROUGHT BACK WONDERFUL STORIES OF THAT OUTER WORLD AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER MORE THAN EVER BEFORE WHETHER SHE WOULD EVER GO INTO IT AND SEE FOR HERSELF WHAT WAS THERE WITH THE THOUGHT SHE ROSE SLOWLY TO HER FEET
3526-176651-0009 MOVED SLOWLY TO THE CLIFF THAT DROPPED SHEER TEN FEET ASIDE FROM THE TRAIL AND STOOD THERE LIKE A GREAT SCARLET FLOWER IN STILL AIR THERE WAS THE WAY AT HER FEET
3526-176651-0010 THAT PATH THAT COILED UNDER THE CLIFF AND RAN DOWN LOOP BY LOOP THROUGH MAJESTIC OAK AND POPLAR AND MASSES OF RHODODENDRON SHE DREW A LONG BREATH AND STIRRED UNEASILY
3526-176651-0011 SHE'D BETTER GO HOME NOW BUT THE PATH HAD A SNAKE LIKE CHARM FOR HER AND STILL SHE STOOD FOLLOWING IT AS FAR DOWN AS SHE COULD WITH HER EYES DOWN IT WENT
3526-176651-0012 WRITHING THIS WAY AND THAT TO A SPUR THAT HAD BEEN SWEPT BARE BY FOREST FIRES ALONG THIS SPUR IT TRAVELLED STRAIGHT FOR A WHILE AND AS HER EYES EAGERLY FOLLOWED IT TO WHERE IT SANK SHARPLY INTO A COVERT OF MAPLES
3526-176651-0013 THE LITTLE CREATURE DROPPED OF A SUDDEN TO THE GROUND AND LIKE SOMETHING WILD LAY FLAT A HUMAN FIGURE HAD FILLED THE LEAFY MOUTH THAT SWALLOWED UP THE TRAIL AND IT WAS COMING TOWARDS HER
3526-176651-0014 WITH A THUMPING HEART SHE PUSHED SLOWLY FORWARD THROUGH THE BRUSH UNTIL HER FACE FOX LIKE WITH CUNNING AND SCREENED BY A BLUEBERRY BUSH HUNG JUST OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND THERE SHE LAY
3526-176651-0015 LIKE A CROUCHED PANTHER CUB LOOKING DOWN FOR A MOMENT ALL THAT WAS HUMAN SEEMED GONE FROM HER EYES BUT AS SHE WATCHED ALL THAT WAS LOST CAME BACK TO THEM
3526-176651-0016 AND SOMETHING MORE SHE HAD SEEN THAT IT WAS A MAN BUT SHE HAD DROPPED SO QUICKLY THAT SHE DID NOT SEE THE BIG BLACK HORSE
3526-176651-0017 NOW BOTH MAN AND HORSE HAD STOPPED THE STRANGER HAD TAKEN OFF HIS GRAY SLOUCHED HAT AND HE WAS WIPING HIS FACE WITH SOMETHING WHITE SOMETHING BLUE WAS TIED LOOSELY ABOUT HIS THROAT
3526-176651-0018 SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN LIKE THAT BEFORE HIS FACE WAS SMOOTH AND LOOKED DIFFERENT AS DID HIS THROAT AND HIS HANDS HIS BREECHES WERE TIGHT
3526-176651-0019 WHICH WAS DEEP IN SEAT HIGH BOTH IN FRONT AND BEHIND AND HAD STRANGE LONG HOODED STIRRUPS STARTING TO MOUNT THE MAN STOPPED WITH ONE FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS HER SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE SHRANK BACK AGAIN
3526-176651-0020 IN HER WONDER OVER HIM SHE ALMOST FORGOT HERSELF FORGOT TO WONDER WHERE HE WAS GOING AND WHY HE WAS COMING INTO THOSE LONELY HILLS UNTIL AS HIS HORSE TURNED A BEND OF THE TRAIL
3526-176651-0021 SHE SAW HANGING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SADDLE SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A GUN HE WAS A RAIDER THAT MAN SO CAUTIOUSLY AND SWIFTLY THEN SHE PUSHED HERSELF BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
3526-176651-0022 SPRANG TO HER FEET DASHED PAST THE BIG TREE AND WINGED WITH FEAR SPED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN LEAVING IN A SPOT OF SUNLIGHT AT THE BASE OF THE PINE
3526-176653-0000 THE FERNS DRENCHED HIS STIRRUPS AS HE BRUSHED THROUGH THEM AND EACH DRIPPING TREE TOP BROKE THE SUNLIGHT AND LET IT DROP IN TENT LIKE BEAMS THROUGH THE SHIMMERING UNDERMIST A BIRD FLASHED HERE AND THERE THROUGH THE GREEN GLOOM
3526-176653-0001 BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND IN THE AIR BUT THE FOOTFALLS OF HIS HORSE AND THE EASY CREAKING OF LEATHER UNDER HIM THE DRIP OF DEW OVERHEAD AND THE RUNNING OF WATER BELOW NOW AND THEN HE COULD SEE THE SAME SLENDER FOOT PRINTS IN THE RICH LOAM
3526-176653-0002 AND HE SAW THEM IN THE SAND WHERE THE FIRST TINY BROOK TINKLED ACROSS THE PATH FROM A GLOOMY RAVINE THERE THE LITTLE CREATURE HAD TAKEN A FLYING LEAP ACROSS IT AND BEYOND HE COULD SEE THE PRINTS NO MORE HE LITTLE GUESSED THAT WHILE HE HALTED TO LET HIS HORSE DRINK
3526-176653-0003 HE TURNED BACK UP THE CREEK AND PASSED SO CLOSE TO WHERE SHE HAD SLIPPED ASIDE INTO THE BUSHES THAT SHE CAME NEAR SHRIEKING BUT HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON A POOL OF THE CREEK ABOVE AND TO HER WONDER HE STROLLED STRAIGHT INTO THE WATER WITH HIS BOOTS ON
3526-176653-0004 PUSHING THE NET IN FRONT OF HIM HE WAS A RAIDER SURE SHE THOUGHT NOW AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR A MOONSHINE STILL AND THE WILD LITTLE THING IN THE BUSHES SMILED CUNNINGLY THERE WAS NO STILL UP THAT CREEK
3526-176653-0005 AND AS HE HAD LEFT HIS HORSE BELOW AND HIS GUN SHE WAITED FOR HIM TO COME BACK WHICH HE DID BY AND BY DRIPPING AND SOAKED TO HIS KNEES THEN SHE SAW HIM UNTIE THE QUEER GUN ON HIS SADDLE PULL IT OUT OF A CASE AND
3526-176653-0006 HER EYES GOT BIG WITH WONDER TAKE IT TO PIECES AND MAKE IT INTO A LONG LIMBER ROD IN A MOMENT HE HAD CAST A MINNOW INTO THE POOL AND WADED OUT INTO THE WATER UP TO HIS HIPS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO QUEER A FISHING POLE SO QUEER A FISHERMAN
3526-176653-0007 HOW COULD HE GET A FISH OUT WITH THAT LITTLE SWITCH SHE THOUGHT CONTEMPTUOUSLY BY AND BY SOMETHING HUMMED QUEERLY THE MAN GAVE A SLIGHT JERK AND A SHINING FISH FLOPPED TWO FEET INTO THE AIR IT WAS SURELY VERY QUEER
3526-176653-0008 BUT STOOD STILL WINDING SOMETHING WITH ONE HAND AND AGAIN THE FISH WOULD FLASH INTO THE AIR AND THEN THAT HUMMING WOULD START AGAIN WHILE THE FISHERMAN WOULD STAND QUIET AND WAITING FOR A WHILE AND THEN HE WOULD BEGIN TO WIND AGAIN IN HER WONDER
3526-176653-0009 DROWNING HIM STEPPING BACKWARD AT THE SAME TIME AND A MOMENT LATER THE FISH SLID EASILY OUT OF THE EDGE OF THE WATER GASPING ALONG THE EDGE OF A LOW SAND BANK AND THE FISHERMAN REACHING DOWN WITH ONE HAND CAUGHT HIM IN THE GILLS THEN
3526-176653-0010 HE LOOKED UP AND SMILED AND SHE HAD SEEN NO SMILE LIKE THAT BEFORE HOWDYE LITTLE GIRL ONE BARE TOE WENT BURROWING SUDDENLY INTO THE SAND ONE FINGER WENT TO HER RED MOUTH AND THAT WAS ALL

3526-176653-0015 HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY A LONG CRY CAME DOWN THE RAVINE

3526-176653-0019 DRAWLED A VOICE FROM THE BUSHES AND IT HAD A TONE THAT MADE THE FISHERMAN WHIRL SUDDENLY A GIANT MOUNTAINEER STOOD ON THE BANK ABOVE HIM WITH A WINCHESTER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM HOW ARE YOU
3526-176653-0020 THE GIANT'S HEAVY EYES LIFTED QUICKLY BUT HE SPOKE TO THE GIRL YOU GO ON HOME

3526-176653-0036 A MAN WITH A WOMAN BEHIND HIM BOTH OLD AND SPECTACLED ALL THREE MOTIONLESS ON THE BANK AND LOOKING AT HIM
3526-176653-0037 ONLY ONE ANSWERED HALE WITH EQUAL CHEER THE OLD WOMAN PUSHED BACK HER BONNET AS HE WADED THROUGH THE WATER TOWARDS THEM AND HE SAW THAT SHE WAS PUFFING A CLAY PIPE SHE LOOKED AT THE FISHERMAN AND HIS TACKLE WITH THE NAIVE WONDER OF A CHILD

3526-176653-0039 HALE SMILED HE LOVED OLD PEOPLE AND TWO KINDER FACES HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO GENTLER VOICES HE HAD NEVER HEARD

3526-176653-0043 LEFT HIS MINNOW BUCKET WHERE IT WAS MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE UP THE PATH ABOUT HIM THE BEECH LEAVES GAVE BACK THE GOLD OF THE AUTUMN SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE RAVINE HIGH UNDER THE CREST OF THE MOTTLED MOUNTAIN WAS ON FIRE WITH THE SCARLET OF MAPLE
3526-176653-0044 WHEN HE GOT TO THE BARE CREST OF A LITTLE RISE HE COULD SEE UP THE CREEK A SPIRAL OF BLUE RISING SWIFTLY FROM A STONE CHIMNEY GEESE AND DUCKS WERE HUNTING CRAWFISH IN THE LITTLE CREEK THAT RAN FROM A MILK HOUSE OF LOGS
3526-176653-0045 HALF HIDDEN BY WILLOWS AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND A TURN IN THE PATH BROUGHT INTO VIEW A LOG CABIN WELL CHINKED WITH STONES AND PLASTER AND WITH A WELL BUILT PORCH A FENCE RAN AROUND THE YARD
3526-176653-0046 GEE HAW I TELL YE AN OX WAGON EVIDENTLY WAS COMING ON AND THE ROAD WAS SO NARROW THAT HE TURNED HIS HORSE INTO THE BUSHES TO LET IT PASS
3526-176653-0047 STILL THERE WAS NO SOUND OF OX OR WAGON AND THE VOICE SOUNDED LIKE A CHILD'S SO HE WENT ON AT A WALK IN THE THICK SAND AND WHEN HE TURNED THE BUSHES HE PULLED UP AGAIN WITH A LOW LAUGH
3526-176653-0048 IN THE ROAD ACROSS THE CREEK WAS A CHUBBY TOW HAIRED BOY WITH A LONG SWITCH IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND A PINE DAGGER AND A STRING IN HIS LEFT ATTACHED TO THE STRING AND TIED BY ONE HIND LEG WAS A FROG
3526-176653-0049 THE BOY WAS USING THE SWITCH AS A GOAD AND DRIVING THE FROG AS AN OX AND HE WAS AS EARNEST AS THOUGH BOTH WERE REAL I GIVE YE A LITTLE REST NOW BUCK HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD EARNESTLY
3526-176653-0050 GEE GEE THE FROG HOPPED SEVERAL TIMES
3526-176653-0051 SAID THE LITTLE FELLOW PANTING IN SYMPATHY
3526-176653-0052 THEN HE LOOKED UP FOR AN INSTANT HE SEEMED TERRIFIED BUT HE DID NOT RUN INSTEAD HE STEALTHILY SHIFTED THE PINE DAGGER OVER TO HIS RIGHT HAND AND THE STRING TO HIS LEFT HERE BOY SAID THE FISHERMAN WITH AFFECTED STERNNESS
3526-176653-0053 WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT DAGGER THE BOY'S BREAST HEAVED AND HIS DIRTY FINGERS CLENCHED TIGHT AROUND THE WHITTLED STICK DON'T YOU TALK TO ME THAT A WAY HE SAID WITH AN OMINOUS SHAKE OF HIS HEAD I'LL GUT YE THE FISHERMAN THREW BACK HIS HEAD
3526-176653-0054 AND HIS PEAL OF LAUGHTER DID WHAT HIS STERNNESS FAILED TO DO THE LITTLE FELLOW WHEELED SUDDENLY AND HIS FEET SPURNED THE SAND AROUND THE BUSHES FOR HOME THE ASTONISHED FROG DRAGGED BUMPING AFTER HIM WELL
3607-135982-0000 THE CARS CAME SCUDDING IN TOWARDS DUBLIN RUNNING EVENLY LIKE PELLETS IN THE GROOVE OF THE NAAS ROAD
3607-135982-0001 CAREERING HOMEWARD AND THROUGH THIS CHANNEL OF POVERTY AND INACTION THE CONTINENT SPED ITS WEALTH AND INDUSTRY NOW AND AGAIN THE CLUMPS OF PEOPLE RAISED THE CHEER OF THE GRATEFULLY OPPRESSED THEIR SYMPATHY HOWEVER WAS FOR THE BLUE CARS
3607-135982-0002 THE CARS OF THEIR FRIENDS THE FRENCH THE FRENCH MOREOVER WERE VIRTUAL VICTORS THEIR TEAM HAD FINISHED SOLIDLY THEY HAD BEEN PLACED SECOND AND THIRD AND THE DRIVER OF THE WINNING GERMAN CAR WAS REPORTED A BELGIAN
3607-135982-0003 EACH BLUE CAR THEREFORE RECEIVED A DOUBLE MEASURE OF WELCOME AS IT TOPPED THE CREST OF THE HILL AND EACH CHEER OF WELCOME WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH SMILES AND NODS BY THOSE IN THE CAR IN ONE OF THESE TRIMLY BUILT CARS WAS A PARTY OF FOUR YOUNG MEN WHOSE SPIRITS SEEMED TO BE AT PRESENT
3607-135982-0004 IN FACT THESE FOUR YOUNG MEN WERE ALMOST HILARIOUS THEY WERE CHARLES SEGOUIN THE OWNER OF THE CAR ANDRE RIVIERE A YOUNG ELECTRICIAN OF CANADIAN BIRTH A HUGE HUNGARIAN NAMED VILLONA
3607-135982-0005 AND A NEATLY GROOMED YOUNG MAN NAMED DOYLE SEGOUIN WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD UNEXPECTEDLY RECEIVED SOME ORDERS IN ADVANCE HE WAS ABOUT TO START A MOTOR ESTABLISHMENT IN PARIS
3607-135982-0006 AND RIVIERE WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE WAS TO BE APPOINTED MANAGER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT THESE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE COUSINS WERE ALSO IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE FRENCH CARS VILLONA WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD HAD A VERY SATISFACTORY LUNCHEON
3607-135982-0007 AND BESIDES HE WAS AN OPTIMIST BY NATURE THE FOURTH MEMBER OF THE PARTY HOWEVER WAS TOO EXCITED TO BE GENUINELY HAPPY HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE WITH A SOFT LIGHT BROWN MOUSTACHE AND RATHER INNOCENT LOOKING GREY EYES
3607-135982-0008 HIS FATHER WHO HAD BEGUN LIFE AS AN ADVANCED NATIONALIST HAD MODIFIED HIS VIEWS EARLY HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY AS A BUTCHER IN KINGSTOWN AND BY OPENING SHOPS IN DUBLIN AND IN THE SUBURBS HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY MANY TIMES OVER
3607-135982-0009 HE HAD ALSO BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SECURE SOME OF THE POLICE CONTRACTS AND IN THE END HE HAD BECOME RICH ENOUGH TO BE ALLUDED TO IN THE DUBLIN NEWSPAPERS AS A MERCHANT PRINCE HE HAD SENT HIS SON TO ENGLAND TO BE EDUCATED IN A BIG CATHOLIC COLLEGE
3607-135982-0010 AND HAD AFTERWARDS SENT HIM TO DUBLIN UNIVERSITY TO STUDY LAW JIMMY DID NOT STUDY VERY EARNESTLY AND TOOK TO BAD COURSES FOR A WHILE HE HAD MONEY AND HE WAS POPULAR AND HE DIVIDED HIS TIME CURIOUSLY BETWEEN MUSICAL AND MOTORING CIRCLES
3607-135982-0011 HIS FATHER REMONSTRATIVE BUT COVERTLY PROUD OF THE EXCESS HAD PAID HIS BILLS AND BROUGHT HIM HOME
3607-135982-0012 WHO HAD SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AND WAS REPUTED TO OWN SOME OF THE BIGGEST HOTELS IN FRANCE SUCH A PERSON AS HIS FATHER AGREED WAS WELL WORTH KNOWING EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THE CHARMING COMPANION HE WAS
3607-135982-0013 VILLONA WAS ENTERTAINING ALSO A BRILLIANT PIANIST BUT UNFORTUNATELY VERY POOR THE CAR RAN ON MERRILY WITH ITS CARGO OF HILARIOUS YOUTH THE TWO COUSINS SAT ON THE FRONT SEAT JIMMY AND HIS HUNGARIAN FRIEND SAT BEHIND
3607-135982-0014 DECIDEDLY VILLONA WAS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS HE KEPT UP A DEEP BASS HUM OF MELODY FOR MILES OF THE ROAD THE FRENCHMEN FLUNG THEIR LAUGHTER AND LIGHT WORDS OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AND OFTEN JIMMY HAD TO STRAIN FORWARD TO CATCH THE QUICK PHRASE
3607-135982-0015 THIS WAS NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT FOR HIM AS HE HAD NEARLY ALWAYS TO MAKE A DEFT GUESS AT THE MEANING AND SHOUT BACK A SUITABLE ANSWER IN THE FACE OF A HIGH WIND BESIDES VILLONA'S HUMMING WOULD CONFUSE ANYBODY THE NOISE OF THE CAR TOO
3607-135982-0016 RAPID MOTION THROUGH SPACE ELATES ONE SO DOES NOTORIETY SO DOES THE POSSESSION OF MONEY THESE WERE THREE GOOD REASONS FOR JIMMY'S EXCITEMENT HE HAD BEEN SEEN BY MANY OF HIS FRIENDS THAT DAY IN THE COMPANY OF THESE CONTINENTALS
3607-135982-0017 AT THE CONTROL SEGOUIN HAD PRESENTED HIM TO ONE OF THE FRENCH COMPETITORS AND IN ANSWER TO HIS CONFUSED MURMUR OF COMPLIMENT THE SWARTHY FACE OF THE DRIVER HAD DISCLOSED A LINE OF SHINING WHITE TEETH
3607-135982-0018 IT WAS PLEASANT AFTER THAT HONOUR TO RETURN TO THE PROFANE WORLD OF SPECTATORS AMID NUDGES AND SIGNIFICANT LOOKS THEN AS TO MONEY HE REALLY HAD A GREAT SUM UNDER HIS CONTROL
3607-135982-0019 BUT JIMMY WHO IN SPITE OF TEMPORARY ERRORS WAS AT HEART THE INHERITOR OF SOLID INSTINCTS KNEW WELL WITH WHAT DIFFICULTY IT HAD BEEN GOT TOGETHER THIS KNOWLEDGE HAD PREVIOUSLY KEPT HIS BILLS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF REASONABLE RECKLESSNESS
3607-135982-0020 AND IF HE HAD BEEN SO CONSCIOUS OF THE LABOUR LATENT IN MONEY WHEN THERE HAD BEEN QUESTION MERELY OF SOME FREAK OF THE HIGHER INTELLIGENCE HOW MUCH MORE SO NOW WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO STAKE THE GREATER PART OF HIS SUBSTANCE IT WAS A SERIOUS THING FOR HIM
3607-135982-0021 JIMMY HAD A RESPECT FOR HIS FATHER'S SHREWDNESS IN BUSINESS MATTERS AND IN THIS CASE IT HAD BEEN HIS FATHER WHO HAD FIRST SUGGESTED THE INVESTMENT MONEY TO BE MADE IN THE MOTOR BUSINESS POTS OF MONEY MOREOVER SEGOUIN HAD THE UNMISTAKABLE AIR OF WEALTH
3607-135982-0022 JIMMY SET OUT TO TRANSLATE INTO DAYS WORK THAT LORDLY CAR IN WHICH HE SAT HOW SMOOTHLY IT RAN IN WHAT STYLE THEY HAD COME CAREERING ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS THE JOURNEY LAID A MAGICAL FINGER ON THE GENUINE PULSE OF LIFE
3607-135982-0023 AND GALLANTLY THE MACHINERY OF HUMAN NERVES STROVE TO ANSWER THE BOUNDING COURSES OF THE SWIFT BLUE ANIMAL THEY DROVE DOWN DAME STREET THE STREET WAS BUSY WITH UNUSUAL TRAFFIC LOUD WITH THE HORNS OF MOTORISTS AND THE GONGS OF IMPATIENT TRAM DRIVERS
3607-135982-0024 NEAR THE BANK SEGOUIN DREW UP AND JIMMY AND HIS FRIEND ALIGHTED A LITTLE KNOT OF PEOPLE COLLECTED ON THE FOOTPATH TO PAY HOMAGE TO THE SNORTING MOTOR THE PARTY WAS TO DINE TOGETHER THAT EVENING IN SEGOUIN'S HOTEL AND MEANWHILE JIMMY AND HIS FRIEND WHO WAS STAYING WITH HIM
3607-135982-0025 WERE TO GO HOME TO DRESS THE CAR STEERED OUT SLOWLY FOR GRAFTON STREET WHILE THE TWO YOUNG MEN PUSHED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE KNOT OF GAZERS THEY WALKED NORTHWARD WITH A CURIOUS FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE EXERCISE WHILE THE CITY HUNG ITS PALE GLOBES OF LIGHT ABOVE THEM
3607-135982-0026 IN A HAZE OF SUMMER EVENING IN JIMMY'S HOUSE THIS DINNER HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED AN OCCASION A CERTAIN PRIDE MINGLED WITH HIS PARENTS TREPIDATION A CERTAIN EAGERNESS ALSO TO PLAY FAST AND LOOSE FOR THE NAMES OF GREAT FOREIGN CITIES HAVE AT LEAST THIS VIRTUE
3607-135982-0027 AND AS HE STOOD IN THE HALL GIVING A LAST EQUATION TO THE BOWS OF HIS DRESS TIE HIS FATHER MAY HAVE FELT EVEN COMMERCIALLY SATISFIED AT HAVING SECURED FOR HIS SON QUALITIES OFTEN UNPURCHASEABLE HIS FATHER THEREFORE WAS UNUSUALLY FRIENDLY WITH VILLONA
3607-135982-0028 AND HIS MANNER EXPRESSED A REAL RESPECT FOR FOREIGN ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT THIS SUBTLETY OF HIS HOST WAS PROBABLY LOST UPON THE HUNGARIAN WHO WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE A SHARP DESIRE FOR HIS DINNER THE DINNER WAS EXCELLENT EXQUISITE
