446-123501-0042 AND I DOUBT THAT WERE ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY TO BE TRANSPORTED TO EARTH HE COULD LIFT HIS OWN WEIGHT FROM THE GROUND IN FACT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO MY FEAT THEN WAS AS MARVELOUS UPON MARS
446-123501-0043 AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UPON EARTH AND FROM DESIRING TO ANNIHILATE ME THEY SUDDENLY LOOKED UPON ME AS A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY TO BE CAPTURED AND EXHIBITED AMONG THEIR FELLOWS THE RESPITE
446-123501-0044 WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR THE WEIGHT OF THESE RIFLES IS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE AND WITH THE SMALL CALIBER EXPLOSIVE RADIUM PROJECTILES WHICH THEY USE AND THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE BARREL
446-123501-0045 THEY ARE DEADLY IN THE EXTREME
446-123501-0046 WHICH WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE ON EARTH THE THEORETIC EFFECTIVE RADIUS OF THIS RIFLE IS THREE HUNDRED MILES BUT THE BEST THEY CAN DO IN ACTUAL SERVICE
446-123501-0047 WHEN EQUIPPED WITH THEIR WIRELESS FINDERS AND SIGHTERS IS BUT A TRIFLE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILES THIS IS QUITE FAR ENOUGH TO IMBUE ME WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MARTIAN FIREARM
446-123501-0048 AND SOME TELEPATHIC FORCE MUST HAVE WARNED ME AGAINST AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT FROM UNDER THE MUZZLES OF TWENTY OF THESE DEATH DEALING MACHINES
446-123501-0049 WHEN THEY HAD COVERED PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED YARDS THEY HALTED AND TURNING THEIR MOUNTS TOWARD US SAT WATCHING THE WARRIOR BY THE ENCLOSURE HE WAS THE ONE WHOSE SPEAR HAD SO NEARLY TRANSFIXED ME
446-123501-0050 AND CAME AROUND THE END OF THE INCUBATOR TOWARD ME ENTIRELY UNARMED AND AS NAKED AS I EXCEPT FOR THE ORNAMENTS STRAPPED UPON HIS HEAD LIMBS AND BREAST
446-123501-0051 WHEN HE WAS WITHIN ABOUT FIFTY FEET OF ME HE UNCLASPED AN ENORMOUS METAL ARMLET AND HOLDING IT TOWARD ME IN THE OPEN PALM OF HIS HAND ADDRESSED ME IN A CLEAR RESONANT VOICE
446-123501-0052 HE THEN STOPPED AS THOUGH WAITING FOR MY REPLY PRICKING UP HIS ANTENNAE LIKE EARS AND COCKING HIS STRANGE LOOKING EYES STILL FURTHER TOWARD ME AS THE SILENCE BECAME PAINFUL
446-123501-0053 I CONCLUDED TO HAZARD A LITTLE CONVERSATION ON MY OWN PART AS I HAD GUESSED THAT HE WAS MAKING OVERTURES OF PEACE THE THROWING DOWN OF HIS WEAPONS AND THE WITHDRAWING OF HIS TROOP BEFORE HIS ADVANCE TOWARD ME
446-123501-0054 SO WHY NOT THEN ON MARS PLACING MY HAND OVER MY HEART I BOWED LOW TO THE MARTIAN AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHILE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE
446-123501-0055 HIS ACTIONS SPOKE FOR THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WERE MOST DEAR TO MY HEART OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BABBLING BROOK FOR ALL THE INTELLIGENCE MY SPEECH CARRIED TO HIM
446-123501-0056 BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THE ACTION WITH WHICH I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED MY WORDS STRETCHING MY HAND TOWARD HIM I ADVANCED AND TOOK THE ARMLET FROM HIS OPEN PALM CLASPING IT ABOUT MY ARM ABOVE THE ELBOW
446-123501-0057 SMILED AT HIM AND STOOD WAITING HIS WIDE MOUTH SPREAD INTO AN ANSWERING SMILE AND LOCKING ONE OF HIS INTERMEDIARY ARMS IN MINE WE TURNED AND WALKED BACK TOWARD HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0058 AT THE SAME TIME HE MOTIONED HIS FOLLOWERS TO ADVANCE THEY STARTED TOWARD US ON A WILD RUN
446-123501-0059 EVIDENTLY HE FEARED THAT WERE I TO BE REALLY FRIGHTENED AGAIN I MIGHT JUMP ENTIRELY OUT OF THE LANDSCAPE HE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS WITH HIS MEN MOTIONED TO ME THAT I WOULD RIDE BEHIND ONE OF THEM AND THEN MOUNTED HIS OWN ANIMAL
446-123501-0060 THE FELLOW DESIGNATED REACHED DOWN TWO OR THREE HANDS AND LIFTED ME UP BEHIND HIM ON THE GLOSSY BACK OF HIS MOUNT
446-123502-0000 CHAPTER FOUR A PRISONER WE HAD GONE PERHAPS TEN MILES WHEN THE GROUND BEGAN TO RISE VERY RAPIDLY WE WERE AS I WAS LATER TO LEARN NEARING THE EDGE OF ONE OF MARS LONG DEAD SEAS IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH
446-123502-0001 MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE MARTIANS HAD TAKEN PLACE IN A SHORT TIME WE GAINED THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND AFTER TRAVERSING A NARROW GORGE CAME TO AN OPEN VALLEY AT THE FAR EXTREMITY OF WHICH WAS A LOW TABLE LAND UPON WHICH I BEHELD
446-123502-0002 AN ENORMOUS CITY TOWARD THIS WE GALLOPED ENTERING IT BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A RUINED ROADWAY LEADING OUT FROM THE CITY BUT ONLY TO THE EDGE OF THE TABLE LAND WHERE IT ENDED ABRUPTLY IN A FLIGHT OF BROAD STEPS
446-123502-0003 UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION I SAW AS WE PASSED THEM THAT THE BUILDINGS WERE DESERTED AND WHILE NOT GREATLY DECAYED HAD THE APPEARANCE OF NOT HAVING BEEN TENANTED FOR YEARS POSSIBLY FOR AGES
446-123502-0004 TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE CITY WAS A LARGE PLAZA AND UPON THIS AND IN THE BUILDINGS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING IT WERE CAMPED SOME NINE OR TEN HUNDRED CREATURES OF THE SAME BREED AS MY CAPTORS
446-123502-0005 FOR SUCH I NOW CONSIDERED THEM DESPITE THE SUAVE MANNER IN WHICH I HAD BEEN TRAPPED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THEIR ORNAMENTS ALL WERE NAKED THE WOMEN VARIED IN APPEARANCE BUT LITTLE FROM THE MEN EXCEPT THAT THEIR TUSKS WERE MUCH LARGER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR HEIGHT
446-123502-0006 IN SOME INSTANCES CURVING NEARLY TO THEIR HIGH SET EARS THEIR BODIES WERE SMALLER AND LIGHTER IN COLOR AND THEIR FINGERS AND TOES BORE THE RUDIMENTS OF NAILS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY LACKING AMONG THE MALES
446-123502-0007 THE ADULT FEMALES RANGED IN HEIGHT FROM TEN TO TWELVE FEET THE CHILDREN WERE LIGHT IN COLOR EVEN LIGHTER THAN THE WOMEN AND ALL LOOKED PRECISELY ALIKE TO ME EXCEPT THAT SOME WERE TALLER
446-123502-0008 WHICH LEADS NO LIVING MARTIAN KNOWS WHITHER AND FROM WHOSE BOSOM NO MARTIAN HAS EVER RETURNED OR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE DID HE RETURN AFTER ONCE EMBARKING UPON ITS COLD DARK WATERS
446-123502-0009 ONLY ABOUT ONE MARTIAN IN A THOUSAND DIES OF SICKNESS OR DISEASE AND POSSIBLY ABOUT TWENTY TAKE THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE THE OTHER NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DIE VIOLENT DEATHS IN DUELS IN HUNTING
446-123502-0010 IN AVIATION AND IN WAR BUT PERHAPS BY FAR THE GREATEST DEATH LOSS COMES DURING THE AGE OF CHILDHOOD WHEN VAST NUMBERS OF THE LITTLE MARTIANS FALL VICTIMS TO THE GREAT WHITE APES OF MARS
446-123502-0011 THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A MARTIAN AFTER THE AGE OF MATURITY IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BUT WOULD BE NEARER THE ONE THOUSAND MARK WERE IT NOT FOR THE VARIOUS MEANS LEADING TO VIOLENT DEATH
446-123502-0012 OWING TO THE WANING RESOURCES OF THE PLANET IT EVIDENTLY BECAME NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE INCREASING LONGEVITY WHICH THEIR REMARKABLE SKILL IN THERAPEUTICS AND SURGERY PRODUCED
446-123502-0013 AND SO HUMAN LIFE HAS COME TO BE CONSIDERED BUT LIGHTLY ON MARS AS IS EVIDENCED BY THEIR DANGEROUS SPORTS AND THE ALMOST CONTINUAL WARFARE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES
446-123502-0014 WITHOUT A WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION AS WE NEARED THE PLAZA AND MY PRESENCE WAS DISCOVERED WE WERE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF THE CREATURES WHO SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PLUCK ME FROM MY SEAT BEHIND MY GUARD A WORD FROM THE LEADER OF THE PARTY
446-123502-0015 STILLED THEIR CLAMOR AND WE PROCEEDED AT A TROT ACROSS THE PLAZA TO THE ENTRANCE OF AS MAGNIFICENT AN EDIFICE AS MORTAL EYE HAS RESTED UPON THE BUILDING WAS LOW BUT COVERED AN ENORMOUS AREA
446-123502-0016 IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OF GLEAMING WHITE MARBLE INLAID WITH GOLD AND BRILLIANT STONES WHICH SPARKLED AND SCINTILLATED IN THE SUNLIGHT THE MAIN ENTRANCE WAS SOME HUNDRED FEET IN WIDTH AND PROJECTED FROM THE BUILDING PROPER
446-123502-0017 TO FORM A HUGE CANOPY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE HALL THERE WAS NO STAIRWAY BUT A GENTLE INCLINE TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING OPENED INTO AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER ENCIRCLED BY GALLERIES ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER
446-123502-0018 WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
446-123502-0019 GAY COLORED FEATHERS AND BEAUTIFULLY WROUGHT LEATHER TRAPPINGS INGENIOUSLY SET WITH PRECIOUS STONES FROM HIS SHOULDERS DEPENDED A SHORT CAPE OF WHITE FUR LINED WITH BRILLIANT SCARLET SILK WHAT STRUCK ME AS MOST REMARKABLE
446-123502-0020 ABOUT THIS ASSEMBLAGE AND THE HALL IN WHICH THEY WERE CONGREGATED WAS THE FACT THAT THE CREATURES WERE ENTIRELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE DESKS CHAIRS AND OTHER FURNISHINGS THESE BEING OF A SIZE ADAPTED TO HUMAN BEINGS SUCH AS I
446-123502-0021 WHEREAS THE GREAT BULKS OF THE MARTIANS
446-123502-0022 NOR WAS THERE ROOM BENEATH THE DESKS FOR THEIR LONG LEGS EVIDENTLY THEN THERE WERE OTHER DENIZENS ON MARS THAN THE WILD AND GROTESQUE CREATURES INTO WHOSE HANDS I HAD FALLEN BUT THE EVIDENCES OF EXTREME ANTIQUITY
446-123502-0023 AND AT A SIGN FROM THE LEADER I HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE GROUND AGAIN LOCKING HIS ARM IN MINE WE HAD PROCEEDED INTO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THERE WERE FEW FORMALITIES OBSERVED IN APPROACHING THE MARTIAN CHIEFTAIN
446-123502-0024 MY CAPTOR MERELY STRODE UP TO THE ROSTRUM THE OTHERS MAKING WAY FOR HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE CHIEFTAIN ROSE TO HIS FEET AND UTTERED THE NAME OF MY ESCORT WHO IN TURN HALTED AND REPEATED THE NAME OF THE RULER FOLLOWED BY HIS TITLE
446-123502-0025 AT THE TIME THIS CEREMONY AND THE WORDS THEY UTTERED MEANT NOTHING TO ME BUT LATER I CAME TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS THE CUSTOMARY GREETING BETWEEN GREEN MARTIANS HAD THE MEN BEEN STRANGERS AND THEREFORE UNABLE TO EXCHANGE NAMES
446-123502-0026 HAD THEIR MISSIONS BEEN PEACEFUL OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE EXCHANGED SHOTS OR HAVE FOUGHT OUT THEIR INTRODUCTION WITH SOME OTHER OF THEIR VARIOUS WEAPONS MY CAPTOR WHOSE NAME WAS TARS TARKAS
446-123502-0027 AND WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED THE CHIEFTAIN ADDRESSED ME AT SOME LENGTH I REPLIED IN OUR GOOD OLD ENGLISH TONGUE MERELY TO CONVINCE HIM THAT NEITHER OF US COULD UNDERSTAND THE OTHER
446-123502-0028 BUT I NOTICED THAT WHEN I SMILED SLIGHTLY ON CONCLUDING HE DID LIKEWISE THIS FACT AND THE SIMILAR OCCURRENCE DURING MY FIRST TALK WITH TARS TARKAS CONVINCED ME THAT WE HAD AT LEAST SOMETHING IN COMMON THE ABILITY TO SMILE
446-123502-0029 THEREFORE TO LAUGH DENOTING A SENSE OF HUMOR BUT I WAS TO LEARN THAT THE MARTIAN SMILE IS MERELY PERFUNCTORY AND THAT THE MARTIAN LAUGH IS A THING TO CAUSE STRONG MEN TO BLANCH IN HORROR THE IDEAS
446-123502-0030 OF INCITANTS TO MERRIMENT THE DEATH AGONIES OF A FELLOW BEING ARE TO THESE STRANGE CREATURES PROVOCATIVE OF THE WILDEST HILARITY WHILE THEIR CHIEF FORM OF COMMONEST AMUSEMENT
446-123502-0031 IS TO INFLICT DEATH ON THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR IN VARIOUS INGENIOUS AND HORRIBLE WAYS THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS AND CHIEFTAINS EXAMINED ME CLOSELY FEELING MY MUSCLES AND THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN
446-123502-0032 THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFTAIN THEN EVIDENTLY SIGNIFIED A DESIRE TO SEE ME PERFORM AND MOTIONING ME TO FOLLOW HE STARTED WITH TARS TARKAS FOR THE OPEN PLAZA NOW I HAD MADE NO ATTEMPT TO WALK SINCE MY FIRST SIGNAL FAILURE
446-123502-0033 AND SO NOW I WENT SKIPPING AND FLITTING ABOUT AMONG THE DESKS AND CHAIRS LIKE SOME MONSTROUS GRASSHOPPER AFTER BRUISING MYSELF SEVERELY
446-123502-0034 AND I DID THE ONLY THING A GENTLEMAN MIGHT DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BRUTALITY BOORISHNESS AND LACK OF CONSIDERATION FOR A STRANGER'S RIGHTS I SWUNG MY FIST SQUARELY TO HIS JAW AND HE WENT DOWN LIKE A FELLED OX
446-123502-0035 AS HE SUNK TO THE FLOOR I WHEELED AROUND WITH MY BACK TOWARD THE NEAREST DESK EXPECTING TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FELLOWS BUT DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM AS GOOD A BATTLE AS THE UNEQUAL ODDS WOULD PERMIT BEFORE I GAVE UP MY LIFE
446-123502-0036 MY FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS HOWEVER AS THE OTHER MARTIANS AT FIRST STRUCK DUMB WITH WONDERMENT FINALLY BROKE INTO WILD PEALS OF LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE APPLAUSE AS SUCH BUT LATER
446-123502-0037 WHEN I HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR CUSTOMS I LEARNED THAT I HAD WON WHAT THEY SELDOM ACCORD A MANIFESTATION OF APPROBATION THE FELLOW WHOM I HAD STRUCK LAY WHERE HE HAD FALLEN
446-123502-0038 BUT I WAS NOT LONG IN BEING ENLIGHTENED THEY FIRST REPEATED THE WORD SAK A NUMBER OF TIMES AND THEN TARS TARKAS MADE SEVERAL JUMPS REPEATING THE SAME WORD BEFORE EACH LEAP THEN TURNING TO ME HE SAID SAK
446-123502-0039 I SAW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER AND GATHERING MYSELF TOGETHER I SAKKED WITH SUCH MARVELOUS SUCCESS THAT I CLEARED A GOOD HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET NOR DID I THIS TIME LOSE MY EQUILIBRIUM BUT LANDED SQUARELY UPON MY FEET
446-123502-0040 WITHOUT FALLING I THEN RETURNED BY EASY JUMPS OF TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY FEET TO THE LITTLE GROUP OF WARRIORS MY EXHIBITION HAD BEEN WITNESSED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED LESSER MARTIANS AND THEY IMMEDIATELY BROKE INTO DEMANDS FOR A REPETITION
446-123502-0041 WHICH THE CHIEFTAIN THEN ORDERED ME TO MAKE BUT I WAS BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND DETERMINED ON THE SPOT THAT MY ONLY METHOD OF SALVATION WAS TO DEMAND THE CONSIDERATION FROM THESE CREATURES
446-123502-0042 WHICH THEY EVIDENTLY WOULD NOT VOLUNTARILY ACCORD I THEREFORE IGNORED THE REPEATED COMMANDS TO SAK AND EACH TIME THEY WERE MADE I MOTIONED TO MY MOUTH AND RUBBED MY STOMACH
446-123502-0043 TARS TARKAS AND THE CHIEF EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS AND THE FORMER CALLING TO A YOUNG FEMALE AMONG THE THRONG GAVE HER SOME INSTRUCTIONS AND MOTIONED ME TO ACCOMPANY HER
446-123502-0044 I GRASPED HER PROFFERED ARM AND TOGETHER WE CROSSED THE PLAZA TOWARD A LARGE BUILDING ON THE FAR SIDE MY FAIR COMPANION WAS ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL HAVING JUST ARRIVED AT MATURITY BUT NOT YET TO HER FULL HEIGHT
446-123502-0045 SHE WAS OF A LIGHT OLIVE GREEN COLOR WITH A SMOOTH GLOSSY HIDE HER NAME AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS SOLA AND SHE BELONGED TO THE RETINUE OF TARS TARKAS SHE CONDUCTED ME TO A SPACIOUS CHAMBER
446-123502-0046 IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS FRONTING ON THE PLAZA AND WHICH FROM THE LITTER OF SILKS AND FURS UPON THE FLOOR I TOOK TO BE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS OF SEVERAL OF THE NATIVES THE ROOM WAS WELL LIGHTED BY A NUMBER OF LARGE WINDOWS
446-123502-0047 AND WAS BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED WITH MURAL PAINTINGS AND MOSAICS
446-123502-0048 MADE A PECULIAR HISSING SOUND AS THOUGH SIGNALING TO SOMEONE IN AN ADJOINING ROOM IN RESPONSE TO HER CALL I OBTAINED MY FIRST SIGHT OF A NEW MARTIAN WONDER IT WADDLED IN ON ITS TEN SHORT LEGS AND SQUATTED DOWN BEFORE THE GIRL
446-123502-0049 LIKE AN OBEDIENT PUPPY THE THING WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHETLAND PONY
4481-17498-0000 THE AUTHOR IS PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT A SEQUEL TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES THE BOOK WHICH WAS RECEIVED WITH SO MUCH FAVOR LAST YEAR YET IT IS NOT NECESSARY ONE SHOULD HAVE READ THE FIRST BOOK TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT VOLUME
4481-17498-0001 THE CHARACTERS BEING TAKEN TO ENTIRELY NEW SCENES THE VARIOUS FOREIGN LOCALITIES ARE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED
4481-17498-0002 WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN SO FORTUNATE MAY ACQUIRE A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THEM
4481-17498-0003 LEST I BE ACCUSED OF UNDUE SENSATIONALISM IN RELATING THE SOMEWHAT DRAMATIC SICILIAN INCIDENT I WILL ASSURE MY READER THAT THE STORY DOES NOT EXAGGERATE PRESENT CONDITIONS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE ISLAND IN FACT IL DUCA AND TATO
4481-17498-0004 ARE DRAWN FROM LIFE ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT HAVE THEIR MOUNTAIN LAIR SO NEAR TO TAORMINA AS I HAVE VENTURED TO LOCATE IT EXCEPT THAT I HAVE ADAPTED THEIR CLEVER SYSTEM OF BRIGANDAGE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF THIS STORY THEIR HISTORY IS TRULY RELATED
4481-17498-0005 MANY WHO HAVE TRAVELLED SOMEWHAT OUTSIDE THE BEATEN TRACKS IN SICILY WILL FRANKLY VOUCH FOR THIS STATEMENT ITALY IS DOING ITS BEST TO SUPPRESS THE MAFIA AND TO ELIMINATE BRIGANDAGE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL ISLANDS IT CONTROLS BUT SO FEW OF THE INHABITANTS ARE ITALIANS
4481-17498-0006 OR IN SYMPATHY WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE WORK OF REFORMATION IS NECESSARILY SLOW AMERICANS ESPECIALLY MUST EXERCISE CAUTION IN TRAVELLING IN ANY PART OF SICILY YET WITH PROPER CARE NOT TO TEMPT THE IRRESPONSIBLE NATIVES
4481-17498-0007 THEY ARE AS SAFE IN SICILY AS THEY ARE AT HOME AUNT JANE'S NIECES ARE SHOWN TO BE AS FRANKLY ADVENTUROUS AS THE AVERAGE CLEAR HEADED AMERICAN GIRL BUT THEIR EXPERIENCES AMID THE ENVIRONMENTS OF AN ANCIENT AND STILL PRIMITIVE CIVILIZATION ARE IN NO WISE EXTRAORDINARY
4481-17498-0008 THE DOYLES ARE ASTONISHED IT WAS SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN MISS PATRICIA DOYLE'S PRETTY FLAT AT THIRTY SEVEN O EIGHT WILLING SQUARE IN THE SMALL DRAWING ROOM PATRICIA OR PATSY AS SHE PREFERRED TO BE CALLED
4481-17498-0009 WAS SEATED AT THE PIANO SOFTLY PLAYING THE ONE PIECE THE MUSIC TEACHER HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRILLING INTO HER FLIGHTY HEAD BY VIRTUE OF MUCH PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE IN A THICK CUSHIONED MORRIS CHAIR RECLINED THE MOTIONLESS FORM OF UNCLE JOHN
4481-17498-0010 A CHUBBY LITTLE MAN IN A GRAY SUIT WHOSE FEATURES WERE TEMPORARILY ECLIPSED BY THE NEWSPAPER THAT WAS SPREAD CAREFULLY OVER THEM OCCASIONALLY A GASP OR A SNORE FROM BENEATH THE PAPER SUGGESTED THAT THE LITTLE MAN WAS SNOOZING
4481-17498-0011 AS HE SOMETIMES GRAVELY CALLED IT INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO THE MUSIC MAJOR DOYLE SAT OPPOSITE STIFFLY ERECT WITH HIS ADMIRING EYES FULL UPON PATSY AT TIMES HE DRUMMED UPON THE ARMS OF HIS CHAIR IN UNISON WITH THE MUSIC
4481-17498-0012 NODDING HIS GRIZZLED HEAD TO MARK THE TIME AS WELL AS TO EMPHASIZE HIS EVIDENT APPROBATION PATSY HAD PLAYED THIS SAME PIECE FROM START TO FINISH SEVEN TIMES SINCE DINNER BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY ONE SHE KNEW
4481-17498-0013 BUT THE MAJOR COULD HAVE LISTENED TO IT SEVEN HUNDRED TIMES WITHOUT THE FLICKER OF AN EYELASH IT WAS NOT THAT HE ADMIRED SO MUCH THE PIECE THE GIRL WAS PLAYING AS THE GIRL WHO WAS PLAYING THE PIECE HIS PRIDE IN PATSY WAS UNBOUNDED
4481-17498-0014 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED AT ALL IN MASTERING THAT IMPOSING LOOKING INSTRUMENT MAKING IT ACTUALLY PLAY CHUNES WAS SURELY A THING TO WONDER AT BUT THEN PATSY COULD DO ANYTHING IF SHE BUT TRIED SUDDENLY UNCLE JOHN GAVE A DREADFUL SNORT
4481-17498-0015 AND SAT BOLT UPRIGHT GAZING AT HIS COMPANIONS WITH A STARTLED LOOK THAT MELTED INTO ONE OF BENIGN COMPLACENCY AS HE OBSERVED HIS SURROUNDINGS AND REALIZED WHERE HE WAS THE INTERRUPTION GAVE PATSY AN OPPORTUNITY TO STOP PLAYING THE TUNE
4481-17498-0016 SHE SWUNG AROUND ON THE STOOL AND LOOKED WITH AMUSEMENT AT HER NEWLY AWAKENED UNCLE YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP SHE SAID NO INDEED QUITE A MISTAKE REPLIED THE LITTLE MAN SERIOUSLY I'VE ONLY BEEN THINKING
4481-17498-0017 AN SUCH BEAUT CHIFUL THOUGHTS OBSERVED THE MAJOR TESTILY FOR HE RESENTED THE INTERRUPTION OF HIS SUNDAY AFTERNOON TREAT YOU THOUGHT EM ALOUD SIR AND THE SOUND OF IT WAS A BAD IMITHATION OF A BULLFROG IN A MARSH
4481-17498-0018 YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE UP EATING THE SALAD SIR BAH DON'T I KNOW ASKED UNCLE JOHN INDIGNANTLY WELL IF YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS BETTER THAN OUR HEARING I SUPPOSE YOU DO RETORTED THE MAJOR BUT TO AN IGNORANT INDIVIDUAL LIKE MESELF
4481-17498-0019 THE IMPRESSION CONVEYED WAS THAT YOU SNORED LIKE A MAN THAT HAS FORGOTTEN HIS MANNERS AN GONE TO SLEEP IN THE PRISENCE OF A LADY THEN NO ONE HAS A BETTER RIGHT TO DO THAT DECLARED PATSY SOOTHINGLY AND I'M SURE OUR DEAR UNCLE JOHN'S THOUGHTS
4481-17498-0020 WERE JUST THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DREAMS IN THE WORLD TELL US OF THEM SIR AND WE'LL PROVE THE MAJOR UTTERLY WRONG EVEN HER FATHER SMILED AT THE GIRL'S DIPLOMACY AND UNCLE JOHN WHO WAS ON THE VERGE OF UNREASONABLE ANGER BEAMED UPON HER GRATEFULLY
4481-17498-0021 I'M GOING TO EUROPE HE SAID THE MAJOR GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY START AND THEN TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM CURIOUSLY AND I'M GOING TO TAKE PATSY ALONG HE CONTINUED WITH A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN THE MAJOR FROWNED
4481-17498-0022 YOU'RE DREAMING AGAIN PATSY SWUNG HER FEET FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR SHE WAS SUCH A LITTLE THING THAT THE STOOL RAISED HER ENTIRELY OFF THE FLOOR THERE WAS A THOUGHTFUL LOOK ON HER ROUND FRECKLED FACE AND A WISTFUL ONE IN HER GREAT BLUE EYES
4481-17498-0023 AS THE FULL MEANING OF UNCLE JOHN'S ABRUPT AVOWAL BECAME APPARENT THE MAJOR WAS STILL FROWNING BUT A HALF FRIGHTENED EXPRESSION HAD REPLACED THE ONE OF SCORNFUL RAILLERY FOR HE TOO KNEW THAT HIS ECCENTRIC BROTHER IN LAW WAS LIKELY TO PROPOSE ANY PREPOSTEROUS THING
4481-17498-0024 AND THEN CARRY IT OUT IN SPITE OF ALL OPPOSITION BUT TO TAKE PATSY TO EUROPE WOULD BE LIKE PULLING THE MAJOR'S EYE TEETH OR AMPUTATING HIS GOOD RIGHT ARM WORSE FAR WORSE IT WOULD MEAN TAKING THE SUNSHINE OUT OF HER OLD FATHER'S SKY ALTOGETHER
4481-17498-0025 AND PAINTING IT A GRIM DESPAIRING GRAY BUT HE RESOLVED NOT TO SUBMIT WITHOUT A STRUGGLE SIR SAID HE STERNLY HE ALWAYS CALLED HIS BROTHER IN LAW SIR WHEN HE WAS IN A SARCASTIC OR REPROACHFUL MOOD I'VE HAD AN IDEA FOR SOME TIME THAT YOU WERE PLOTTING MISCHIEF
4481-17498-0026 I WILL ASK YOU TO EXPLAIN TO US SIR THE BRUTAL SUGGESTION YOU HAVE JUST ADVANCED UNCLE JOHN LAUGHED IN THE DAYS WHEN MAJOR DOYLE HAD THOUGHT HIM A POOR MAN AND IN NEED OF A HELPING HAND
4481-17498-0027 THE GRIZZLED OLD IRISHMAN HAD BEEN AS TENDER TOWARD HIM AS A WOMAN AND STUDIOUSLY AVOIDED ANY SPEECH OR EPITHET THAT BY CHANCE MIGHT INJURE THE FEELINGS OF HIS DEAD WIFE'S ONLY BROTHER BUT THE MAJOR'S INVARIABLE COURTESY TO THE POOR OR UNFORTUNATE
4481-17498-0028 WAS NO LONGER IN EVIDENCE WHEN HE FOUND THAT JOHN MERRICK WAS A MULTI MILLIONAIRE WITH A STRONGLY DEFINED HABIT OF DOING GOOD TO OTHERS AND STRIVING IN OBSCURE AND UNCONVENTIONAL WAYS TO MAKE EVERYBODY AROUND HIM HAPPY
4481-17498-0029 HIS AFFECTION FOR THE LITTLE MAN INCREASED MIGHTILY BUT HIS RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE PROMPTLY CHANGED AND A CHANCE TO REPROVE OR DISCOMFIT HIS ABSURDLY RICH BROTHER IN LAW WAS ONE OF HIS MOST SATISFACTORY DIVERSIONS UNCLE JOHN APPRECIATED THIS
4481-17498-0030 AND HOLDING THE DIGNIFIED MAJOR IN LOVING REGARD WAS GLAD TO CROSS SWORDS WITH HIM NOW AND THEN TO ADD VARIETY TO THEIR PLEASANT RELATIONS IT'S THIS WAY MAJOR DOYLE HE NOW REMARKED COOLLY
