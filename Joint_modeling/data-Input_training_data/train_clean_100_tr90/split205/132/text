5104-33407-0020 SO HE STEERED FOR IT AS THEY CAME NEAR THE MEN SAID SEE THE GREAT TREES AND THE SOFT GREEN SHORE SURELY THIS IS A BETTER COUNTRY THAN GREENLAND OR THAN ICELAND EITHER
5104-33407-0021 WHEN THEY LANDED THEY THREW THEMSELVES UPON THE GROUND I NEVER LAY ON A BED SO SOFT AS THIS GRASS ONE SAID TALLER TREES DO NOT GROW IN NORWAY SAID ANOTHER
5104-33407-0022 THERE IS NO STONE HERE AS IN NORWAY BUT ONLY GOOD BLACK DIRT LEIF SAID I NEVER SAW SO FERTILE A LAND BEFORE THE MEN WERE HUNGRY AND SET ABOUT BUILDING A FIRE THERE IS NO LACK OF FUEL HERE
5104-33407-0023 THEY SAID THEY STAYED MANY DAYS IN THIS COUNTRY AND WALKED ABOUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THERE A GERMAN NAMED TYRKER WAS WITH LEIF HE WAS A LITTLE MAN WITH A HIGH FOREHEAD AND A SHORT NOSE HIS EYES WERE BIG AND ROLLING
5104-33407-0024 HE HAD LIVED WITH ERIC FOR MANY YEARS AND HAD TAKEN CARE OF LEIF WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY SO LEIF LOVED HIM NOW ONE DAY THEY HAD BEEN WANDERING ABOUT AND ALL CAME BACK TO CAMP AT NIGHT EXCEPT TYRKER WHEN LEIF LOOKED AROUND ON HIS COMRADES HE SAID
5104-33407-0025 WHERE IS TYRKER NO ONE KNEW THEN LEIF WAS ANGRY IS A MAN OF SO LITTLE VALUE IN THIS EMPTY LAND THAT YOU WOULD LOSE ONE HE SAID WHY DID YOU NOT KEEP TOGETHER DID YOU NOT SEE THAT HE WAS GONE
5104-33407-0026 WHY DID YOU NOT SET OUT TO LOOK FOR HIM WHO KNOWS WHAT TERRIBLE THING MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM IN THESE GREAT FORESTS THEN HE TURNED AND STARTED OUT TO HUNT FOR HIM HIS MEN FOLLOWED SILENT AND ASHAMED
5104-33407-0027 AGAIN LEIF ASKED HIS QUESTION AND PUT HIS HAND ON TYRKER'S SHOULDER AS THOUGH HE WOULD SHAKE HIM THEN TYRKER ANSWERED IN THE LANGUAGE OF ICELAND I HAVE NOT BEEN SO VERY FAR BUT I HAVE FOUND SOMETHING WONDERFUL WHAT IS IT
5104-33407-0028 CRIED THE MEN I HAVE FOUND GRAPES GROWING WILD ANSWERED TYRKER AND HE LAUGHED AND HIS EYES SHONE IT CANNOT BE LEIF SAID GRAPES DO NOT GROW IN GREENLAND NOR IN ICELAND NOR EVEN IN NORWAY
5104-33407-0029 SO IT SEEMED A WONDERFUL THING TO THESE NORSEMEN CAN I NOT TELL GRAPES WHEN I SEE THEM CRIED TYRKER DID I NOT GROW UP IN GERMANY WHERE EVERY HILLSIDE IS COVERED WITH GRAPEVINES AH IT SEEMS LIKE MY OLD HOME
5104-33407-0030 IT IS WONDERFUL LEIF SAID I HAVE HEARD TRAVELERS TELL OF SEEING GRAPES GROWING BUT I MYSELF NEVER SAW IT YOU SHALL TAKE US TO THEM EARLY IN THE MORNING TYRKER SO IN THE MORNING THEY WENT BACK INTO THE WOODS AND SAW THE GRAPES
5104-33407-0031 THEY ATE OF THEM THEY ARE LIKE FOOD AND DRINK THEY CRIED THAT DAY LEIF SAID WE SPENT MOST OF THE SUMMER ON THE OCEAN WINTER WILL SOON BE COMING ON AND THE SEA ABOUT GREENLAND WILL BE FROZEN WE MUST START BACK
5104-33407-0032 WE WILL FILL THE ROWBOAT WITH GRAPES AND TOW IT BEHIND US THE SHIP WE WILL LOAD WITH LOGS FROM THESE GREAT TREES THAT WILL BE A WELCOME SHIPLOAD IN GREENLAND WHERE WE HAVE NEITHER TREES NOR VINES
5104-33407-0033 NOW HALF OF YOU SHALL GATHER GRAPES FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND THE OTHER HALF SHALL CUT TIMBER SO THEY DID AND AFTER A WEEK SAILED OFF THE SHIP WAS FULL OF LUMBER AND THEY TOWED THE ROWBOAT LOADED WITH GRAPES
5104-33407-0034 AS THEY LOOKED BACK AT THE SHORE LEIF SAID I WILL CALL THIS COUNTRY WINELAND FOR THE GRAPES THAT GROW THERE ONE OF THE MEN LEAPED UPON THE GUNWALE AND LEANED OUT CLINGING TO THE SAIL AND SANG
5104-33407-0035 WINELAND THE GREEN THE GREAT THE FAT OUR DRAGON FED AND CRAWLS AWAY WITH BELLY STUFFED AND LAZY FEET HOW LONG HER PURPLE TRAILING TAIL SHE FED AND GREW TO TWICE HER SIZE
5104-33407-0036 THEN ALL THE MEN WAVED THEIR HANDS TO THE SHORE AND GAVE A GREAT SHOUT FOR THAT GOOD LAND FOR ALL THAT VOYAGE THEY HAD FAIR WEATHER AND SAILED INTO ERIC'S HARBOR BEFORE THE WINTER CAME
5104-33407-0037 ERIC SAW THE SHIP AND RAN DOWN TO THE SHORE HE TOOK LEIF INTO HIS ARMS AND SAID OH MY SON MY OLD EYES ACHED TO SEE YOU I HUNGER TO HEAR OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND DONE
5104-33407-0038 LUCK HAS FOLLOWED ME ALL THE WAY SAID LEIF SEE WHAT I HAVE BROUGHT HOME THE GREENLANDERS LOOKED LUMBER LUMBER THEY CRIED OH IT IS BETTER STUFF THAN GOLD
5104-33407-0039 THEN THEY SAW THE GRAPES AND TASTED THEM SURELY YOU MUST HAVE PLUNDERED ASGARD THEY SAID SMACKING THEIR LIPS AT THE FEAST THAT NIGHT ERIC SAID LEIF SHALL SIT IN THE PLACE OF HONOR
5104-33407-0040 SO LEIF SAT IN THE HIGH SEAT OPPOSITE ERIC ALL MEN THOUGHT HIM A HANDSOME AND WISE MAN HE TOLD THEM OF THE STORM AND OF WINELAND NO MAN WOULD EVER NEED A CLOAK THERE THE SOIL IS RICHER THAN THE SOIL OF NORWAY
5104-33407-0041 GRAIN GROWS WILD AND YOU YOURSELVES SAW THE GRAPES THAT WE GOT FROM THERE THE FORESTS ARE WITHOUT END THE SEA IS FULL OF FISH THE GREENLANDERS LISTENED WITH OPEN MOUTHS TO ALL THIS
5104-33407-0042 LEIF NOTICED TWO STRANGERS AN OLD MAN WHO SAT AT ERIC'S SIDE AND A YOUNG WOMAN ON THE CROSS BENCH HE TURNED TO HIS BROTHER THORSTEIN WHO SAT NEXT TO HIM WHO ARE THESE STRANGERS HE ASKED
5104-33407-0043 THORBIORN AND HIS DAUGHTER GUDRID THORSTEIN ANSWERED THEY LANDED HERE THIS SPRING I NEVER SAW OUR FATHER MORE GLAD OF ANYTHING THAN TO SEE THIS THORBIORN THEY WERE FRIENDS BEFORE WE LEFT ICELAND
5104-33407-0044 WHEN THEY SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN THEY COULD NOT TALK ENOUGH OF OLD TIMES IN THE SPRING ERIC MEANS TO GIVE HIM A FARM UP THE FIORD A WAY IT SEEMS THAT THIS THORBIORN COMES OF A GOOD FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN RICH AND GREAT IN ICELAND FOR YEARS
5104-33407-0045 AND THORBIORN HIMSELF WAS RICH WHEN OUR FATHER KNEW HIM AND WAS MUCH HONORED BY ALL MEN BUT ILL LUCK CAME AND HE GREW POOR THIS HURT HIS PRIDE I WILL NOT STAY IN ICELAND AND BE A BEGGAR
5104-33407-0046 HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT HAVE MEN LOOK AT ME AND SAY HE IS NOT WHAT HIS FATHER WAS I WILL GO TO MY FRIEND ERIC THE RED IN GREENLAND THEN HE GOT READY A GREAT FEAST AND INVITED ALL HIS FRIENDS
5104-33407-0047 IT WAS SUCH A FEAST AS HAD NOT BEEN IN ICELAND FOR YEARS THORBIORN SPENT ON IT ALL THE WEALTH THAT HE HAD LEFT FOR HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT LEAVE IN SHAME MEN SHALL REMEMBER MY LAST FEAST
5104-33407-0048 AFTER THAT HE SET OUT AND CAME TO GREENLAND IS NOT GUDRID BEAUTIFUL AND SHE IS WISE I MEAN TO MARRY HER IF HER FATHER WILL PERMIT IT
5104-33407-0049 NOW LEIF SETTLED DOWN IN GREENLAND AND BECAME A GREAT MAN THERE HE WAS SO BUSY AND HE GREW SO RICH THAT HE DID NOT THINK OF GOING TO WINELAND AGAIN BUT PEOPLE COULD NOT FORGET HIS STORY
5163-18515-0000 WHEN THE BOAT WAS NEARING THE ISLAND OF MARKEN THE LITTLE YELLOW CHEESE HAD BEEN PRESENTED WITH ALL DUE FORMALITY TO ONE OF THE SAILORS WHO HAD BEEN SPECIALLY KIND IN THE MATTER OF SECURING GOOD SEATS FOR MISTER KING'S PARTY POLLY AND PHRONSIE HAVING HELD A WHISPERED CONFERENCE IN A RETIRED NOOK

5163-18515-0017 POLLY WAS ALREADY GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF HOLDING UP AN IMAGINARY APRON AND AT LAST THE LITTLE GIRL UNDERSTOOD BY GESTURES WHAT SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY GET INTO HER HEAD BY WORDS SO SHE PICKED UP THE SKIRT OF HER GOWN IN HER STURDY LITTLE FISTS

5163-18515-0039 THERE WAS MISSUS FISHER UP BY THE TINY WINDOW BENDING OVER AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD SPREAD OUT IN HER LAP SOME WHITE EMBROIDERED GARMENTS WHILE A YOUNG WOMAN HOVERED NEAR SMILING AND BLUSHING AND VERY HAPPY AT ALL THIS NOTICE

5163-39921-0000 WHY MISTER CROPPER CHANGED HIS MIND WELL MISS MAXWELL HOW DID YOU GET ALONG TODAY ASKED MISTER BAXTER AFFABLY WHEN THE NEW TEACHER CAME TO THE TABLE SHE WAS A SLIGHT DARK GIRL RATHER PLAIN LOOKING
5163-39921-0001 BUT WITH A SMART ENERGETIC WAY MISTER BAXTER APPROVED OF HER HE LIKED HER STYLE AS HE WOULD HAVE SAID THE SUMMER TERM HAD JUST OPENED IN THE MAITLAND DISTRICT ESTHER MAXWELL WAS A STRANGER
5163-39921-0002 BUT SHE WAS A CAPABLE GIRL AND HAD NO DOUBT OF HER OWN ABILITY TO GET AND KEEP THE SCHOOL IN GOOD WORKING ORDER SHE SMILED BRIGHTLY AT MISTER BAXTER VERY WELL FOR A BEGINNING THE CHILDREN SEEM BRIGHT AND TEACHABLE
5163-39921-0003 AND NOT HARD TO CONTROL MISTER BAXTER NODDED THERE ARE NO BAD CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL EXCEPT THE CROPPER BOYS AND THEY CAN BE GOOD ENOUGH IF THEY LIKE RECKON THEY WEREN'T THERE TODAY NO
5163-39921-0004 WELL MISS MAXWELL I THINK IT ONLY FAIR TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE WITH THOSE BOYS WHEN THEY DO COME FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED YOU KNOW MISTER CROPPER WAS OPPOSED TO OUR HIRING YOU
5163-39921-0005 NOT OF COURSE THAT HE HAD ANY PERSONAL OBJECTION TO YOU BUT HE IS SET AGAINST FEMALE TEACHERS AND WHEN A CROPPER IS SET THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH CAN CHANGE HIM HE SAYS FEMALE TEACHERS CAN'T KEEP ORDER
5163-39921-0006 THEY KNOW HE'LL BACK THEM UP IN SECRET NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO JUST TO PROVE HIS OPINIONS CROPPER IS SLY AND SLIPPERY AND IT IS HARD TO CORNER HIM ARE THE BOYS BIG QUERIED ESTHER ANXIOUSLY
5163-39921-0007 YES THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN AND BIG FOR THEIR AGE YOU CAN'T WHIP EM THAT IS THE TROUBLE A MAN MIGHT BUT THEY'D TWIST YOU AROUND THEIR FINGERS YOU'LL HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL I'M AFRAID
5163-39921-0008 BUT MAYBE THEY'LL BEHAVE ALL RIGHT AFTER ALL MISTER BAXTER PRIVATELY HAD NO HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BUT ESTHER HOPED FOR THE BEST SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT MISTER CROPPER WOULD CARRY HIS PREJUDICES INTO A PERSONAL APPLICATION
5163-39921-0009 THIS CONVICTION WAS STRENGTHENED WHEN HE OVERTOOK HER WALKING FROM SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY AND DROVE HER HOME HE WAS A BIG HANDSOME MAN WITH A VERY SUAVE POLITE MANNER HE ASKED INTERESTEDLY ABOUT HER SCHOOL AND HER WORK
5163-39921-0010 HOPED SHE WAS GETTING ON WELL AND SAID HE HAD TWO YOUNG RASCALS OF HIS OWN TO SEND SOON ESTHER FELT RELIEVED SHE THOUGHT THAT MISTER BAXTER HAD EXAGGERATED MATTERS A LITTLE THAT PLUM TREE OF MISSUS CHARLEY'S IS LOADED WITH FRUIT AGAIN THIS YEAR
5163-39921-0011 REMARKED MISTER BAXTER AT THE TEA TABLE THAT EVENING I CAME PAST IT TODAY ON MY WAY CROSS LOTS HOME FROM THE WOODS THERE WILL BE BUSHELS OF PLUMS ON IT
5163-39921-0012 I DON'T SUPPOSE POOR MISSUS CHARLEY WILL GET ONE OF THEM ANY MORE THAN SHE EVER HAS SAID MISSUS BAXTER INDIGNANTLY IT'S A BURNING SHAME THAT'S WHAT IT IS I JUST WISH SHE COULD CATCH THE CROPPERS ONCE
5163-39921-0013 YOU HAVEN'T ANY PROOF THAT IT IS REALLY THEM MARY OBJECTED HER HUSBAND AND YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE RECKLESS ACCUSATIONS BEFORE FOLKS I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS THEM
5163-39921-0014 AND MISSUS CHARLEY KNOWS IT TOO ALTHOUGH SHE CAN'T PROVE IT MORE'S THE PITY I DON'T SAY ISAAC CROPPER STEALS THOSE PLUMS WITH HIS OWN HANDS BUT HE KNOWS WHO DOES AND THE PLUMS GO INTO MEHITABLE CROPPER'S PRESERVING KETTLE
5163-39921-0015 THERE'S NOTHING SURER YOU SEE MISS MAXWELL IT'S THIS WAY EXPLAINED MISTER BAXTER TURNING TO ESTHER MISSUS CHARLEY CROPPER'S HUSBAND WAS ISAAC'S BROTHER
5163-39921-0016 THEY NEVER GOT ON WELL TOGETHER AND WHEN CHARLEY DIED THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS FUSS ABOUT THE PROPERTY ISAAC ACTED MEAN AND SCANDALOUS CLEAR THROUGH AND PUBLIC OPINION HAS BEEN DOWN ON HIM EVER SINCE
5163-39921-0017 BUT MISSUS CHARLEY IS A PRETTY SMART WOMAN AND HE DIDN'T GET THE BETTER OF HER IN EVERYTHING THERE WAS A STRIP OF DISPUTED LAND BETWEEN THE TWO FARMS AND SHE SECURED IT THERE'S A BIG PLUM TREE GROWING ON IT CLOSE TO THE LINE FENCE
5163-39921-0018 IT'S THE FINEST ONE IN MAITLAND BUT MISSUS CHARLEY NEVER GETS A PLUM FROM IT
