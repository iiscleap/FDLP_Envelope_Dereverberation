298-126791-0029 HER EYES WERE UNIFORMLY FASTENED ON THE POINT WHERE THE ROAD WAS SUDDENLY LOST BY THE INTERVENTION OF A HILL AND AT EACH TURN AS SHE LOST SIGHT OF THE SPOT SHE LINGERED UNTIL AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF HER SISTER QUICKENED HER PACE TO AN EVEN MOTION WITH THAT OF HER OWN
298-126791-0030 AT LENGTH A SINGLE HORSE CHAISE WAS SEEN MAKING ITS WAY CAREFULLY AMONG THE STONES WHICH LAY SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY ROAD THAT WOUND THROUGH THE VALLEY AND APPROACHED THE COTTAGE
298-126791-0031 THE COLOR OF FRANCES CHANGED AS THE VEHICLE GRADUALLY DREW NEARER AND WHEN SHE WAS ENABLED TO SEE A FEMALE FORM IN IT BY THE SIDE OF A BLACK IN LIVERY HER LIMBS SHOOK WITH AN AGITATION THAT COMPELLED HER TO LEAN ON SARAH FOR SUPPORT IN A FEW MINUTES THE TRAVELERS APPROACHED THE GATE
298-126791-0032 IT WAS THROWN OPEN BY A DRAGOON WHO FOLLOWED THE CARRIAGE AND WHO HAD BEEN THE MESSENGER DISPATCHED BY DUNWOODIE TO THE FATHER OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON MISS PEYTON ADVANCED TO RECEIVE THEIR GUEST AND THE SISTERS UNITED IN GIVING HER THE KINDEST WELCOME
298-126791-0033 STILL FRANCES COULD WITH DIFFICULTY WITHDRAW HER TRUANT EYES FROM THE COUNTENANCE OF THEIR VISITOR SHE WAS YOUNG AND OF A LIGHT AND FRAGILE FORM BUT OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS HER EYES WERE LARGE FULL BLACK PIERCING AND AT TIMES A LITTLE WILD HER HAIR WAS LUXURIANT
298-126791-0034 AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT THE POWDER IT WAS THEN THE FASHION TO WEAR IT FELL IN RAVEN BLACKNESS A FEW OF ITS LOCKS HAD FALLEN ON HER CHEEK GIVING ITS CHILLING WHITENESS BY THE CONTRAST A MORE DEADLY CHARACTER
298-126791-0035 DOCTOR SITGREAVES SUPPORTED HER FROM THE CHAISE AND WHEN SHE GAINED THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA SHE TURNED AN EXPRESSIVE LOOK ON THE FACE OF THE PRACTITIONER YOUR BROTHER IS OUT OF DANGER AND WISHES TO SEE YOU MISS SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON THE LADY BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS
298-126791-0036 FRANCES HAD STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE ACTION AND FACE OF ISABELLA WITH A KIND OF UNEASY ADMIRATION BUT SHE NOW SPRANG TO HER SIDE WITH THE ARDOR OF A SISTER AND KINDLY DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HER OWN LED THE WAY TO A RETIRED ROOM
298-126791-0037 THE FEELING WAS COMMUNICATED TO ALL THE SPECTATORS AND THEY DISPERSED IN PURSUIT OF THEIR USUAL AVOCATIONS ISABELLA YIELDED TO THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF FRANCES WITHOUT RESISTANCE
298-126791-0038 AND HAVING GAINED THE ROOM WHERE THE LATTER CONDUCTED HER WEPT IN SILENCE ON THE SHOULDER OF THE OBSERVANT AND SOOTHING GIRL UNTIL FRANCES THOUGHT HER TEARS EXCEEDED THE EMOTION NATURAL TO THE OCCASION
298-126791-0039 THE SOBS OF MISS SINGLETON FOR A TIME WERE VIOLENT AND UNCONTROLLABLE UNTIL WITH AN EVIDENT EXERTION SHE YIELDED TO A KIND OBSERVATION OF HER COMPANION AND SUCCEEDED IN SUPPRESSING HER TEARS RAISING HER FACE TO THE EYES OF FRANCES SHE ROSE
298-126791-0040 MORE COMPOSED THAN HER PREVIOUS AGITATION HAD GIVEN REASON TO EXPECT ISABELLA FOUND HER BROTHER LOOKING BETTER AND IN LESS DANGER THAN HER SENSITIVE IMAGINATION HAD LED HER TO SUPPOSE HER SPIRITS ROSE IN PROPORTION FROM DESPONDENCY SHE PASSED TO SOMETHING LIKE GAYETY
298-126791-0041 HER BEAUTIFUL EYES SPARKLED WITH RENOVATED BRILLIANCY AND HER FACE WAS LIGHTED WITH SMILES SO FASCINATING THAT FRANCES WHO IN COMPLIANCE WITH HER EARNEST ENTREATIES HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE SICK CHAMBER SAT GAZING ON A COUNTENANCE THAT POSSESSED SO WONDERFUL VARIABILITY
298-126791-0042 IMPELLED BY A CHARM THAT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL THE YOUTH HAD THROWN AN EARNEST LOOK AT FRANCES AS SOON AS HIS SISTER RAISED HERSELF FROM HIS ARMS AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE FIRST GLANCE AT THE LOVELY LINEAMENTS OF OUR HEROINE
298-126791-0043 WHEN THE GAZER TURNED HIS EYES FROM THE VIEW IN DISAPPOINTMENT HE SEEMED BEWILDERED RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN AWAKING FROM A DREAM AND MUSED WHERE IS DUNWOODIE ISABELLA HE SAID THE EXCELLENT FELLOW IS NEVER WEARY OF KIND ACTIONS AFTER A DAY OF SUCH SERVICE AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
298-126791-0044 HE HAS SPENT THE NIGHT IN BRINGING ME A NURSE WHOSE PRESENCE ALONE IS ABLE TO RAISE ME FROM MY COUCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE LADY'S COUNTENANCE CHANGED
298-126791-0045 BUT ISABELLA THE MEETING HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU YOU TREMBLE ISABELLA MADE NO REPLY SHE STRETCHED HER HAND TOWARDS THE TABLE WHICH HELD THE NOURISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN AND THE ATTENTIVE FRANCES COMPREHENDED HER WISHES IN A MOMENT A GLASS OF WATER IN SOME MEASURE REVIVED THE SISTER WHO WAS ENABLED TO SAY
298-126791-0046 DOUBTLESS IT IS HIS DUTY TWAS SAID ABOVE A ROYAL PARTY WAS MOVING ON THE RIVER THOUGH I PASSED THE TROOPS BUT TWO MILES FROM THIS SPOT THE LATTER PART OF THE SENTENCE WAS HARDLY AUDIBLE AND IT WAS SPOKEN MORE IN THE MANNER OF A SOLILOQUY THAN AS IF FOR THE EARS OF HER COMPANIONS
298-126791-0047 ON THE MARCH ISABELLA EAGERLY INQUIRED HER BROTHER NO DISMOUNTED AND SEEMINGLY AT REST WAS THE REPLY THE WONDERING DRAGOON TURNED HIS GAZE ON THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS SISTER WHO SAT WITH HER EYE BENT ON THE CARPET IN UNCONSCIOUS ABSENCE BUT FOUND NO EXPLANATION
298-126791-0048 HIS LOOK WAS CHANGED TO THE FACE OF FRANCES WHO STARTLED BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS EXPRESSION AROSE AND HASTILY INQUIRED IF HE WOULD HAVE ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU CAN PARDON THE RUDENESS SAID THE WOUNDED OFFICER MAKING A FEEBLE EFFORT TO RAISE HIS BODY I WOULD REQUEST TO HAVE CAPTAIN LAWTON'S COMPANY FOR A MOMENT
298-126791-0049 FRANCES HASTENED INSTANTLY TO COMMUNICATE HIS WISH TO THAT GENTLEMAN AND IMPELLED BY AN INTEREST SHE COULD NOT CONTROL SHE RETURNED AGAIN TO HER SEAT BY THE SIDE OF MISS SINGLETON LAWTON SAID THE YOUTH IMPATIENTLY AS THE TROOPER ENTERED HEAR YOU FROM THE MAJOR
298-126791-0050 THE EYE OF THE SISTER WAS NOW BENT ON THE FACE OF THE TROOPER WHO MADE HIS SALUTATIONS TO THE LADY WITH EASE BLENDED WITH THE FRANKNESS OF A SOLDIER HIS MAN HAS BEEN HERE TWICE HE SAID TO INQUIRE HOW WE FARED IN THE LAZARETTO AND WHY NOT HIMSELF
298-126791-0051 THAT IS A QUESTION THE MAJOR CAN ANSWER BEST BUT YOU KNOW THE REDCOATS ARE ABROAD AND DUNWOODIE COMMANDS IN THE COUNTY THESE ENGLISH MUST BE LOOKED TO TRUE SAID SINGLETON SLOWLY AS IF STRUCK WITH THE OTHER'S REASONS BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU ARE IDLE WHEN THERE IS WORK TO DO
298-126791-0052 MY SWORD ARM IS NOT IN THE BEST CONDITION AND ROANOKE HAS BUT A SHAMBLING GAIT THIS MORNING BESIDES THERE IS ANOTHER REASON I COULD MENTION IF IT WERE NOT THAT MISS WHARTON WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME
298-126791-0053 SPEAK I BEG WITHOUT DREAD OF MY DISPLEASURE SAID FRANCES RETURNING THE GOOD HUMORED SMILE OF THE TROOPER WITH THE ARCHNESS NATURAL TO HER OWN SWEET FACE THE ODORS OF YOUR KITCHEN THEN CRIED LAWTON BLUNTLY FORBID MY QUITTING THE DOMAINS UNTIL I QUALIFY MYSELF TO SPEAK WITH MORE CERTAINTY CONCERNING THE FATNESS OF THE LAND
298-126791-0054 OH AUNT JEANETTE IS EXERTING HERSELF TO DO CREDIT TO MY FATHER'S HOSPITALITY SAID THE LAUGHING GIRL AND I AM A TRUANT FROM HER LABORS AS I SHALL BE A STRANGER TO HER FAVOR UNLESS I PROFFER MY ASSISTANCE
298-126791-0055 FRANCES WITHDREW TO SEEK HER AUNT MUSING DEEPLY ON THE CHARACTER AND EXTREME SENSIBILITY OF THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE CHANCE HAD BROUGHT TO THE COTTAGE THE WOUNDED OFFICER FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES AS SHE MOVED WITH INFANTILE GRACE THROUGH THE DOOR OF HIS APARTMENT AND AS SHE VANISHED FROM HIS VIEW HE OBSERVED
298-126791-0056 A GOOD MOTHERLY LADY BUT AS TO LOVE THAT IS A MATTER OF TASTE A FEW YEARS YOUNGER WITH DEFERENCE TO HER PRUDENCE AND EXPERIENCE WOULD ACCORD BETTER WITH MY FANCY SHE MUST BE UNDER TWENTY SAID THE OTHER QUICKLY IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY YOU COUNT IF YOU BEGIN AT THE HEEL OF LIFE WELL
298-126791-0057 BUT IF YOU RECKON DOWNWARD AS IS MOST COMMON I THINK SHE IS NEARER FORTY YOU HAVE MISTAKEN AN ELDER SISTER FOR THE AUNT SAID ISABELLA LAYING HER FAIR HAND ON THE MOUTH OF THE INVALID YOU MUST BE SILENT YOUR FEELINGS ARE BEGINNING TO AFFECT YOUR FRAME
298-126791-0058 THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES WHO IN SOME ALARM NOTICED THE INCREASE OF FEVERISH SYMPTOMS IN HIS PATIENT ENFORCED THIS MANDATE AND THE TROOPER WITHDREW TO PAY A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE TO ROANOKE WHO HAD BEEN AN EQUAL SUFFERER WITH HIMSELF IN THEIR LAST NIGHT'S SOMERSAULT
298-126791-0059 TO HIS GREAT JOY HIS MAN PRONOUNCED THE STEED TO BE EQUALLY CONVALESCENT WITH THE MASTER AND LAWTON FOUND THAT BY DINT OF RUBBING THE ANIMAL'S LIMBS SEVERAL HOURS WITHOUT CEASING HE WAS ENABLED TO PLACE HIS FEET IN WHAT HE CALLED SYSTEMATIC MOTION
298-126791-0060 ORDERS WERE ACCORDINGLY GIVEN TO BE IN READINESS TO REJOIN THE TROOP AT THE FOUR CORNERS AS SOON AS HIS MASTER HAD SHARED IN THE BOUNTY OF THE APPROACHING BANQUET
298-126791-0061 AND BY HIS SYMPATHY SUCCEEDED IN RESTORING THE COLONEL TO HIS OWN GOOD GRACES
298-126791-0062 WHARTON KNEW THAT THEIR MISFORTUNE AS THEY BOTH TERMED THEIR DEFEAT WAS OWING TO THE OTHER'S RASHNESS BUT HE FORBORE TO SPEAK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT WHICH HAD DEPRIVED THE ENGLISH OF THEIR LEADER AND TO WHICH HE GOOD NATUREDLY ASCRIBED THEIR SUBSEQUENT DISCOMFITURE
298-126791-0063 IN SHORT WHARTON SAID THE COLONEL PUTTING ONE LEG OUT OF BED IT MAY BE CALLED A COMBINATION OF UNTOWARD EVENTS YOUR OWN UNGOVERNABLE HORSE PREVENTED MY ORDERS FROM BEING CARRIED TO THE MAJOR IN SEASON TO FLANK THE REBELS VERY TRUE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN KICKING A SLIPPER TOWARDS THE BED
298-126791-0064 HAD WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW GOOD FIRES UPON THEM IN FLANK WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THESE BRAVE VIRGINIANS TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AYE AND THAT IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME CRIED THE COLONEL MAKING THE OTHER LEG FOLLOW ITS COMPANION THEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO ROUT THE GUIDES YOU KNOW AND THE MOVEMENT GAVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE
298-126791-0065 YES SAID THE OTHER SENDING THE SECOND SLIPPER AFTER THE FIRST AND THIS MAJOR DUNWOODIE NEVER OVERLOOKS AN ADVANTAGE I THINK IF WE HAD THE THING TO DO OVER AGAIN CONTINUED THE COLONEL RAISING HIMSELF ON HIS FEET WE MIGHT ALTER THE CASE VERY MATERIALLY THOUGH THE CHIEF THING THE REBELS HAVE NOW TO BOAST OF IS MY CAPTURE
298-126791-0066 THEY WERE REPULSED YOU SAW IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO DRIVE US FROM THE WOOD AT LEAST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY MADE AN ATTACK SAID THE CAPTAIN THROWING THE REST OF HIS CLOTHES WITHIN REACH OF THE COLONEL
298-126791-0067 TRUE TRUE CRIED THE COLONEL WITH ANIMATION HAD I BEEN THERE TO HAVE IMPROVED THAT ADVANTAGE WE MIGHT HAVE TURNED THE TABLE ON THE YANKEES SAYING WHICH HE DISPLAYED STILL GREATER ANIMATION IN COMPLETING HIS TOILET AND HE WAS SOON PREPARED TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE FULLY RESTORED TO HIS OWN GOOD OPINION AND FAIRLY PERSUADED THAT HIS CAPTURE WAS OWING TO CASUALTIES ABSOLUTELY BEYOND THE CONTROL OF MAN
2989-138028-0000 CHAPTER SIX OF WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS NIECE AND HOUSEKEEPER ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTERS IN THE WHOLE HISTORY
2989-138028-0001 BUT IT WAS ALL PREACHING IN THE DESERT AND HAMMERING COLD IRON NEVERTHELESS AMONG MANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO HIM THE HOUSEKEEPER SAID TO HIM IN TRUTH MASTER IF YOU DO NOT KEEP STILL AND STAY QUIET AT HOME
2989-138028-0002 WHAT ANSWER GOD WILL GIVE TO YOUR COMPLAINTS HOUSEKEEPER I KNOW NOT NOR WHAT HIS MAJESTY WILL ANSWER EITHER I ONLY KNOW THAT IF I WERE KING I SHOULD DECLINE TO ANSWER THE NUMBERLESS SILLY PETITIONS THEY PRESENT EVERY DAY
2989-138028-0003 AND THEREFORE I SHOULD BE SORRY THAT ANY AFFAIRS OF MINE SHOULD WORRY HIM WHEREUPON THE HOUSEKEEPER SAID TELL US SENOR AT HIS MAJESTY'S COURT ARE THERE NO KNIGHTS THERE ARE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE AND PLENTY OF THEM AND IT IS RIGHT THERE SHOULD BE
2989-138028-0004 TO SET OFF THE DIGNITY OF THE PRINCE AND FOR THE GREATER GLORY OF THE KING'S MAJESTY THEN MIGHT NOT YOUR WORSHIP SAID SHE BE ONE OF THOSE THAT WITHOUT STIRRING A STEP SERVE THEIR KING AND LORD IN HIS COURT
2989-138028-0005 THERE MUST BE ALL SORTS IN THE WORLD
2989-138028-0006 THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE AND ANOTHER FOR THE COURTIERS WITHOUT QUITTING THEIR CHAMBERS OR THE THRESHOLD OF THE COURT RANGE THE WORLD OVER BY LOOKING AT A MAP WITHOUT ITS COSTING THEM A FARTHING AND WITHOUT SUFFERING HEAT OR COLD HUNGER OR THIRST
2989-138028-0007 BUT WE THE TRUE KNIGHTS ERRANT MEASURE THE WHOLE EARTH WITH OUR OWN FEET EXPOSED TO THE SUN TO THE COLD TO THE AIR TO THE INCLEMENCIES OF HEAVEN BY DAY AND NIGHT ON FOOT AND ON HORSEBACK
2989-138028-0008 NOR DO WE ONLY KNOW ENEMIES IN PICTURES BUT IN THEIR OWN REAL SHAPES AND AT ALL RISKS AND ON ALL OCCASIONS WE ATTACK THEM WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO CHILDISH POINTS OR RULES OF SINGLE COMBAT WHETHER ONE HAS OR HAS NOT A SHORTER LANCE OR SWORD
2989-138028-0009 WHETHER ONE CARRIES RELICS OR ANY SECRET CONTRIVANCE ABOUT HIM WHETHER OR NOT THE SUN IS TO BE DIVIDED AND PORTIONED OUT AND OTHER NICETIES OF THE SORT THAT ARE OBSERVED IN SET COMBATS OF MAN TO MAN THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BUT I DO
2989-138028-0010 AND YOU MUST KNOW BESIDES THAT THE TRUE KNIGHT ERRANT THOUGH HE MAY SEE TEN GIANTS THAT NOT ONLY TOUCH THE CLOUDS WITH THEIR HEADS BUT PIERCE THEM AND THAT GO EACH OF THEM ON TWO TALL TOWERS BY WAY OF LEGS AND WHOSE ARMS ARE LIKE THE MASTS OF MIGHTY SHIPS AND EACH EYE LIKE A GREAT MILL WHEEL
2989-138028-0011 AND GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN A GLASS FURNACE MUST NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT BE DISMAYED BY THEM ON THE CONTRARY HE MUST ATTACK AND FALL UPON THEM WITH A GALLANT BEARING AND A FEARLESS HEART AND IF POSSIBLE VANQUISH AND DESTROY THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE FOR ARMOUR THE SHELLS OF A CERTAIN FISH
2989-138028-0012 WIELD TRENCHANT BLADES OF DAMASCUS STEEL OR CLUBS STUDDED WITH SPIKES ALSO OF STEEL SUCH AS I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE SEEN
2989-138028-0013 AND IT WOULD BE WELL IF THERE WERE NO PRINCE WHO DID NOT SET A HIGHER VALUE ON THIS SECOND OR MORE PROPERLY SPEAKING FIRST KIND OF KNIGHTS ERRANT FOR AS WE READ IN THEIR HISTORIES
2989-138028-0014 I WOULD INFLICT A CHASTISEMENT UPON THEE FOR THE BLASPHEMY THOU HAST UTTERED THAT ALL THE WORLD SHOULD RING WITH WHAT CAN IT BE THAT A YOUNG HUSSY THAT HARDLY KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE A DOZEN LACE BOBBINS DARES TO WAG HER TONGUE AND CRITICISE THE HISTORIES OF KNIGHTS ERRANT
2989-138028-0015 FOR HE WAS THE MOST HUMBLE MINDED AND COURTEOUS KNIGHT OF HIS TIME
2989-138028-0016 BUT SOME THERE ARE THAT MIGHT HAVE HEARD THEE AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WELL FOR THEE IN THAT CASE FOR THEY ARE NOT ALL COURTEOUS OR MANNERLY SOME ARE ILL CONDITIONED SCOUNDRELS NOR IS IT EVERYONE THAT CALLS HIMSELF A GENTLEMAN THAT IS SO IN ALL RESPECTS SOME ARE GOLD OTHERS PINCHBECK
2989-138028-0017 AND ONE HAS NEED OF EXPERIENCE AND DISCERNMENT TO DISTINGUISH THESE TWO KINDS OF GENTLEMEN
2989-138028-0018 GOD BLESS ME SAID THE NIECE THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW SO MUCH UNCLE
2989-138028-0019 AND YET THAT YOU SHOULD FALL INTO A DELUSION SO GREAT AND A FOLLY SO MANIFEST AS TO TRY TO MAKE YOURSELF OUT VIGOROUS WHEN YOU ARE OLD STRONG WHEN YOU ARE SICKLY ABLE TO PUT STRAIGHT WHAT IS CROOKED WHEN YOU YOURSELF ARE BENT BY AGE AND ABOVE ALL A CABALLERO WHEN YOU ARE NOT ONE
2989-138028-0020 ALL THE LINEAGES IN THE WORLD ATTEND TO WHAT I AM SAYING CAN BE REDUCED TO FOUR SORTS WHICH ARE THESE THOSE THAT HAD HUMBLE BEGINNINGS AND WENT ON SPREADING AND EXTENDING THEMSELVES UNTIL THEY ATTAINED SURPASSING GREATNESS THOSE THAT HAD GREAT BEGINNINGS AND MAINTAINED THEM
2989-138028-0021 AND STILL MAINTAIN AND UPHOLD THE GREATNESS OF THEIR ORIGIN THOSE AGAIN THAT FROM A GREAT BEGINNING HAVE ENDED IN A POINT LIKE A PYRAMID HAVING REDUCED AND LESSENED THEIR ORIGINAL GREATNESS
2989-138028-0022 THOSE THAT HAD AN HUMBLE ORIGIN AND ROSE TO THE GREATNESS THEY STILL PRESERVE
2989-138028-0023 FOR EXAMPLES OF THE SECOND SORT OF LINEAGE THAT BEGAN WITH GREATNESS AND MAINTAINS IT STILL WITHOUT ADDING TO IT
2989-138028-0024 OF COUNTLESS PRINCES MONARCHS LORDS MEDES ASSYRIANS PERSIANS GREEKS AND BARBARIANS ALL THESE LINEAGES AND LORDSHIPS HAVE ENDED IN A POINT AND COME TO NOTHING
2989-138028-0025 FOR IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE NOW TO FIND ONE OF THEIR DESCENDANTS AND EVEN SHOULD WE FIND ONE IT WOULD BE IN SOME LOWLY AND HUMBLE CONDITION OF PLEBEIAN LINEAGES I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY SAVE THAT THEY MERELY SERVE TO SWELL THE NUMBER OF THOSE THAT LIVE
2989-138028-0026 AND NOT BY SPENDING AS HE PLEASES BUT BY KNOWING HOW TO SPEND IT WELL THE POOR GENTLEMAN HAS NO WAY OF SHOWING THAT HE IS A GENTLEMAN BUT BY VIRTUE BY BEING AFFABLE WELL BRED COURTEOUS GENTLE MANNERED AND KINDLY NOT HAUGHTY ARROGANT OR CENSORIOUS
2989-138028-0027 BUT ABOVE ALL BY BEING CHARITABLE FOR BY TWO MARAVEDIS GIVEN WITH A CHEERFUL HEART TO THE POOR HE WILL SHOW HIMSELF AS GENEROUS AS HE WHO DISTRIBUTES ALMS WITH BELL RINGING AND NO ONE THAT PERCEIVES HIM TO BE ENDOWED WITH THE VIRTUES I HAVE NAMED
2989-138028-0028 EVEN THOUGH HE KNOW HIM NOT WILL FAIL TO RECOGNISE AND SET HIM DOWN AS ONE OF GOOD BLOOD AND IT WOULD BE STRANGE WERE IT NOT SO PRAISE HAS EVER BEEN THE REWARD OF VIRTUE AND THOSE WHO ARE VIRTUOUS CANNOT FAIL TO RECEIVE COMMENDATION
2989-138028-0029 THERE ARE TWO ROADS MY DAUGHTERS BY WHICH MEN MAY REACH WEALTH AND HONOURS ONE IS THAT OF LETTERS THE OTHER THAT OF ARMS
2989-138028-0030 I AM THEREFORE IN A MEASURE CONSTRAINED TO FOLLOW THAT ROAD
2989-138028-0031 AND IT WILL BE LABOUR IN VAIN FOR YOU TO URGE ME TO RESIST WHAT HEAVEN WILLS FATE ORDAINS REASON REQUIRES AND ABOVE ALL MY OWN INCLINATION FAVOURS FOR KNOWING AS I DO THE COUNTLESS TOILS THAT ARE THE ACCOMPANIMENTS OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY
2989-138028-0032 I KNOW TOO THE INFINITE BLESSINGS THAT ARE ATTAINED BY IT I KNOW THAT THE PATH OF VIRTUE IS VERY NARROW AND THE ROAD OF VICE BROAD AND SPACIOUS I KNOW THEIR ENDS AND GOALS ARE DIFFERENT FOR THE BROAD AND EASY ROAD OF VICE ENDS IN DEATH
2989-138028-0033 I KNOW AS OUR GREAT CASTILIAN POET SAYS THAT IT IS BY RUGGED PATHS LIKE THESE THEY GO THAT SCALE THE HEIGHTS OF IMMORTALITY UNREACHED BY THOSE THAT FALTER HERE BELOW
2989-138028-0034 I CAN TELL YOU NIECE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE IF THESE CHIVALROUS THOUGHTS DID NOT ENGAGE ALL MY FACULTIES THERE WOULD BE NOTHING THAT I COULD NOT DO NOR ANY SORT OF KNICKKNACK THAT WOULD NOT COME FROM MY HANDS PARTICULARLY CAGES AND TOOTH PICKS
2989-138028-0035 AT THIS MOMENT THERE CAME A KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
2989-138028-0036 NOTHING SENOR SAMSON SAID SHE ONLY THAT MY MASTER IS BREAKING OUT PLAINLY BREAKING OUT WHEREABOUTS IS HE BREAKING OUT SENORA ASKED SAMSON HAS ANY PART OF HIS BODY BURST HE IS ONLY BREAKING OUT AT THE DOOR OF HIS MADNESS SHE REPLIED
2989-138028-0037 SO THAT TO BRING HIM ROUND AGAIN EVER SO LITTLE COST ME MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED EGGS
2989-138028-0038 THAT I CAN WELL BELIEVE REPLIED THE BACHELOR FOR THEY ARE SO GOOD AND SO FAT AND SO WELL BRED THAT THEY WOULD NOT SAY ONE THING FOR ANOTHER THOUGH THEY WERE TO BURST FOR IT IN SHORT THEN MISTRESS HOUSEKEEPER THAT IS ALL
2989-138028-0039 SAY THE PRAYER OF SANTA APOLLONIA THAT IS IF YOU KNOW IT FOR I WILL COME PRESENTLY AND YOU WILL SEE MIRACLES WOE IS ME CRIED THE HOUSEKEEPER
2989-138028-0040 THAT WOULD DO IF IT WAS THE TOOTHACHE MY MASTER HAD
2989-138028-0041 I KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING MISTRESS HOUSEKEEPER
2989-138028-0042 REPLIED CARRASCO AND WITH THIS THE HOUSEKEEPER RETIRED
2989-138028-0043 AND ARRANGE WITH HIM WHAT WILL BE TOLD IN ITS PROPER PLACE
2989-138028-0044 ONCE OR TWICE AS WELL AS I REMEMBER REPLIED SANCHO
2989-138028-0045 FOR I KNOW NOT WHAT I AM SO FOCILE MEANS
2989-138028-0046 AND SUBMIT TO WHAT I TEACH THEE I WOULD BET SAID SANCHO THAT FROM THE VERY FIRST YOU UNDERSTOOD ME AND KNEW WHAT I MEANT BUT YOU WANTED TO PUT ME OUT THAT YOU MIGHT HEAR ME MAKE ANOTHER COUPLE OF DOZEN BLUNDERS MAY BE SO REPLIED DON QUIXOTE
2989-138028-0047 BUT TO COME TO THE POINT WHAT DOES TERESA SAY TERESA SAYS
2989-138028-0048 AND SO SAY I SAID DON QUIXOTE CONTINUE SANCHO MY FRIEND GO ON YOU TALK PEARLS TO DAY THE FACT IS CONTINUED SANCHO
2989-138028-0049 AND THE LAMB GOES AS SOON AS THE SHEEP AND NOBODY CAN PROMISE HIMSELF MORE HOURS OF LIFE IN THIS WORLD THAN GOD MAY BE PLEASED TO GIVE HIM
2989-138028-0050 AND THAT THE SAME HE PAID ME OUT OF YOUR ESTATE FOR I DON'T CARE TO STAND ON REWARDS WHICH EITHER COME LATE OR ILL OR NEVER AT ALL GOD HELP ME WITH MY OWN
2989-138028-0051 AND SO LONG AS ONE GAINS SOMETHING THERE IS NOTHING LOST
2989-138028-0052 AND SO WELL UNDERSTOOD RETURNED DON QUIXOTE THAT I HAVE SEEN INTO THE DEPTHS OF THY THOUGHTS AND KNOW THE MARK THOU ART SHOOTING AT WITH THE COUNTLESS SHAFTS OF THY PROVERBS
2989-138028-0053 PLEASE TO RETURN TO MY SERVICE WELL AND GOOD BUT TO SUPPOSE THAT I AM GOING TO DISTURB OR UNHINGE THE ANCIENT USAGE OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY IS ALL NONSENSE AND SO MY SANCHO GET YOU BACK TO YOUR HOUSE AND EXPLAIN MY INTENTIONS TO YOUR TERESA
2989-138028-0054 BENE QUIDEM IF NOT WE REMAIN FRIENDS FOR IF THE PIGEON HOUSE DOES NOT LACK FOOD IT WILL NOT LACK PIGEONS AND BEAR IN MIND MY SON THAT A GOOD HOPE IS BETTER THAN A BAD HOLDING AND A GOOD GRIEVANCE BETTER THAN A BAD COMPENSATION
2989-138028-0055 AND IN SHORT I MEAN TO SAY AND I DO SAY THAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO COME ON REWARD WITH ME AND RUN THE SAME CHANCE THAT I RUN GOD BE WITH YOU
2989-138028-0056 THE ARCH WAG SAMSON CAME FORWARD AND EMBRACING HIM AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE O FLOWER OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY O SHINING LIGHT OF ARMS O HONOUR AND MIRROR OF THE SPANISH NATION
2989-138028-0057 MAY GOD ALMIGHTY IN HIS INFINITE POWER GRANT THAT ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WHO WOULD IMPEDE OR HINDER THY THIRD SALLY MAY FIND NO WAY OUT OF THE LABYRINTH OF THEIR SCHEMES NOR EVER ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY MOST DESIRE AND THEN TURNING TO THE HOUSEKEEPER HE SAID
2989-138028-0058 FOR I KNOW IT IS THE POSITIVE DETERMINATION OF THE SPHERES THAT SENOR DON QUIXOTE SHALL PROCEED TO PUT INTO EXECUTION HIS NEW AND LOFTY DESIGNS AND I SHOULD LAY A HEAVY BURDEN ON MY CONSCIENCE DID I NOT URGE AND PERSUADE THIS KNIGHT NOT TO KEEP THE MIGHT OF HIS STRONG ARM AND THE VIRTUE OF HIS VALIANT SPIRIT
2989-138028-0059 ANY LONGER CURBED AND CHECKED FOR BY HIS INACTIVITY HE IS DEFRAUDING THE WORLD OF THE REDRESS OF WRONGS
2989-138028-0060 OF THE HONOUR OF VIRGINS OF THE AID OF WIDOWS AND OF THE SUPPORT OF WIVES AND OTHER MATTERS OF THIS KIND APPERTAINING BELONGING PROPER AND PECULIAR
