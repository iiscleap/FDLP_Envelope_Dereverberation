458-126294-0014 YOU SIMPLETONS YOU SHOULD HAVE CUT THE ROSE BUSH IN TWO AND HAVE BROKEN OFF THE ROSE AND BROUGHT IT HOME WITH YOU GO AND DO IT AT ONCE THEY HAD THEREFORE TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR THE SECOND TIME THE CHILDREN HOWEVER SAW THEM COMING FROM A DISTANCE THEN LINA SAID FUNDEVOGEL
458-126294-0015 NEVER LEAVE ME AND I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU FUNDEVOGEL SAID NEITHER NOW NOR EVER SAID LINA THEN DO YOU BECOME A CHURCH AND I'LL BE THE CHANDELIER IN IT SO WHEN THE THREE SERVANTS CAME NOTHING WAS THERE BUT A CHURCH WITH A CHANDELIER IN IT
458-126294-0016 THEY SAID THEREFORE TO EACH OTHER WHAT CAN WE DO HERE LET US GO HOME WHEN THEY GOT HOME THE COOK ASKED IF THEY HAD NOT FOUND THEM SO THEY SAID NO THEY HAD FOUND NOTHING BUT A CHURCH AND THERE WAS A CHANDELIER IN IT AND THE COOK SCOLDED THEM AND SAID
458-126294-0017 YOU FOOLS WHY DID YOU NOT PULL THE CHURCH TO PIECES AND BRING THE CHANDELIER HOME WITH YOU AND NOW THE OLD COOK HERSELF GOT ON HER LEGS AND WENT WITH THE THREE SERVANTS IN PURSUIT OF THE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN HOWEVER SAW FROM AFAR THAT THE THREE SERVANTS WERE COMING
458-126294-0018 AND THE COOK WADDLING AFTER THEM THEN SAID LINA FUNDEVOGEL NEVER LEAVE ME AND I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU THEN SAID FUNDEVOGEL NEITHER NOW NOR EVER SAID LINA BE A FISHPOND AND I WILL BE THE DUCK UPON IT
458-126305-0000 THE LITTLE PEASANT THERE WAS A CERTAIN VILLAGE WHEREIN NO ONE LIVED BUT REALLY RICH PEASANTS AND JUST ONE POOR ONE WHOM THEY CALLED THE LITTLE PEASANT HE HAD NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS A COW AND STILL LESS MONEY TO BUY ONE
458-126305-0001 AND YET HE AND HIS WIFE DID SO WISH TO HAVE ONE ONE DAY HE SAID TO HER LISTEN I HAVE A GOOD IDEA THERE IS OUR GOSSIP THE CARPENTER HE SHALL MAKE US A WOODEN CALF AND PAINT IT BROWN SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER AND IN TIME
458-126305-0002 IT WILL CERTAINLY GET BIG AND BE A COW THE WOMAN ALSO LIKED THE IDEA AND THEIR GOSSIP THE CARPENTER CUT AND PLANED THE CALF AND PAINTED IT AS IT OUGHT TO BE AND MADE IT WITH ITS HEAD HANGING DOWN AS IF IT WERE EATING NEXT MORNING WHEN THE COWS WERE BEING DRIVEN OUT
458-126305-0003 THE LITTLE PEASANT CALLED THE COW HERD IN AND SAID LOOK I HAVE A LITTLE CALF THERE BUT IT IS STILL SMALL AND HAS TO BE CARRIED THE COW HERD SAID ALL RIGHT AND TOOK IT IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED IT TO THE PASTURE AND SET IT AMONG THE GRASS
458-126305-0004 THE LITTLE CALF ALWAYS REMAINED STANDING LIKE ONE WHICH WAS EATING AND THE COW HERD SAID IT WILL SOON RUN BY ITSELF JUST LOOK HOW IT EATS ALREADY AT NIGHT WHEN HE WAS GOING TO DRIVE THE HERD HOME AGAIN HE SAID TO THE CALF
458-126305-0005 IF YOU CAN STAND THERE AND EAT YOUR FILL YOU CAN ALSO GO ON YOUR FOUR LEGS I DON'T CARE TO DRAG YOU HOME AGAIN IN MY ARMS
458-126305-0006 AND WHEN THE COW HERD DROVE THE COWS THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND THE CALF WAS MISSING HE INQUIRED WHERE IT WAS THE COW HERD ANSWERED IT IS STILL STANDING OUT THERE EATING IT WOULD NOT STOP AND COME WITH US BUT THE LITTLE PEASANT SAID
458-126305-0007 OH BUT I MUST HAVE MY BEAST BACK AGAIN THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE MEADOW TOGETHER BUT SOMEONE HAD STOLEN THE CALF AND IT WAS GONE THE COW HERD SAID IT MUST HAVE RUN AWAY THE PEASANT HOWEVER SAID DON'T TELL ME THAT
458-126305-0008 AND LED THE COW HERD BEFORE THE MAYOR WHO FOR HIS CARELESSNESS CONDEMNED HIM TO GIVE THE PEASANT A COW FOR THE CALF WHICH HAD RUN AWAY AND NOW THE LITTLE PEASANT AND HIS WIFE HAD THE COW FOR WHICH THEY HAD SO LONG WISHED AND THEY WERE HEARTILY GLAD
458-126305-0009 BUT THEY HAD NO FOOD FOR IT AND COULD GIVE IT NOTHING TO EAT SO IT SOON HAD TO BE KILLED THEY SALTED THE FLESH AND THE PEASANT WENT INTO THE TOWN AND WANTED TO SELL THE SKIN THERE SO THAT HE MIGHT BUY A NEW CALF WITH THE PROCEEDS ON THE WAY HE PASSED BY A MILL
458-126305-0010 AND THERE SAT A RAVEN WITH BROKEN WINGS AND OUT OF PITY HE TOOK HIM AND WRAPPED HIM IN THE SKIN BUT AS THE WEATHER GREW SO BAD AND THERE WAS A STORM OF RAIN AND WIND HE COULD GO NO FARTHER AND TURNED BACK TO THE MILL AND BEGGED FOR SHELTER
458-126305-0011 THE MILLER'S WIFE WAS ALONE IN THE HOUSE AND SAID TO THE PEASANT LAY YOURSELF ON THE STRAW THERE AND GAVE HIM A SLICE OF BREAD AND CHEESE THE PEASANT ATE IT AND LAY DOWN WITH HIS SKIN BESIDE HIM AND THE WOMAN THOUGHT HE IS TIRED AND HAS GONE TO SLEEP
458-126305-0012 IN THE MEANTIME CAME THE PARSON THE MILLER'S WIFE RECEIVED HIM WELL AND SAID MY HUSBAND IS OUT SO WE WILL HAVE A FEAST THE PEASANT LISTENED AND WHEN HE HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT FEASTING HE WAS VEXED THAT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO MAKE SHIFT WITH A SLICE OF BREAD AND CHEESE
458-126305-0013 THEN THE WOMAN SERVED UP FOUR DIFFERENT THINGS ROAST MEAT SALAD CAKES AND WINE JUST AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO SIT DOWN AND EAT THERE WAS A KNOCKING OUTSIDE THE WOMAN SAID OH HEAVENS IT IS MY HUSBAND SHE QUICKLY HID THE ROAST MEAT INSIDE THE TILED STOVE
458-126305-0014 THE WINE UNDER THE PILLOW THE SALAD ON THE BED THE CAKES UNDER IT AND THE PARSON IN THE CLOSET ON THE PORCH THEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR FOR HER HUSBAND AND SAID THANK HEAVEN YOU ARE BACK AGAIN
458-126305-0015 THERE IS SUCH A STORM IT LOOKS AS IF THE WORLD WERE COMING TO AN END THE MILLER SAW THE PEASANT LYING ON THE STRAW AND ASKED WHAT IS THAT FELLOW DOING THERE AH SAID THE WIFE THE POOR KNAVE CAME IN THE STORM AND RAIN AND BEGGED FOR SHELTER
458-126305-0016 THE MAN SAID I HAVE NO OBJECTION BUT BE QUICK AND GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT THE WOMAN SAID BUT I HAVE NOTHING BUT BREAD AND CHEESE I AM CONTENTED WITH ANYTHING REPLIED THE HUSBAND SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED BREAD AND CHEESE WILL DO AND LOOKED AT THE PEASANT AND SAID
458-126305-0017 COME AND EAT SOME MORE WITH ME THE PEASANT DID NOT REQUIRE TO BE INVITED TWICE BUT GOT UP AND ATE AFTER THIS THE MILLER SAW THE SKIN IN WHICH THE RAVEN WAS LYING ON THE GROUND AND ASKED WHAT HAVE YOU THERE THE PEASANT ANSWERED I HAVE A SOOTHSAYER INSIDE IT
458-126305-0018 CAN HE FORETELL ANYTHING TO ME SAID THE MILLER WHY NOT ANSWERED THE PEASANT BUT HE ONLY SAYS FOUR THINGS AND THE FIFTH HE KEEPS TO HIMSELF THE MILLER WAS CURIOUS AND SAID
458-126305-0019 AND WENT THITHER AND FOUND THE ROAST MEAT
458-126305-0020 THIRDLY HE SAYS THAT THERE IS SOME SALAD ON THE BED THAT WOULD BE A FINE THING CRIED THE MILLER AND WENT THERE AND FOUND THE SALAD
458-126305-0021 FOURTHLY HE SAYS THAT THERE ARE SOME CAKES UNDER THE BED THAT WOULD BE A FINE THING CRIED THE MILLER AND LOOKED THERE AND FOUND THE CAKES AND NOW THE TWO SAT DOWN TO THE TABLE TOGETHER BUT THE MILLER'S WIFE WAS FRIGHTENED TO DEATH AND WENT TO BED AND TOOK ALL THE KEYS WITH HER
458-126305-0022 THE MILLER WOULD HAVE LIKED MUCH TO KNOW THE FIFTH BUT THE LITTLE PEASANT SAID FIRST WE WILL QUICKLY EAT THE FOUR THINGS FOR THE FIFTH IS SOMETHING BAD SO THEY ATE AND AFTER THAT THEY BARGAINED HOW MUCH THE MILLER WAS TO GIVE FOR THE FIFTH PROPHECY
458-126305-0023 UNTIL THEY AGREED ON THREE HUNDRED TALERS THEN THE PEASANT ONCE MORE PINCHED THE RAVEN'S HEAD TILL HE CROAKED LOUDLY THE MILLER ASKED WHAT DID HE SAY THE PEASANT REPLIED HE SAYS THAT THE DEVIL IS HIDING OUTSIDE THERE IN THE CLOSET ON THE PORCH THE MILLER SAID
458-126305-0024 THE DEVIL MUST GO OUT AND OPENED THE HOUSE DOOR THEN THE WOMAN WAS FORCED TO GIVE UP THE KEYS AND THE PEASANT UNLOCKED THE CLOSET THE PARSON RAN OUT AS FAST AS HE COULD AND THE MILLER SAID IT WAS TRUE I SAW THE BLACK RASCAL WITH MY OWN EYES
458-126305-0025 THE PEASANT HOWEVER MADE OFF NEXT MORNING BY DAYBREAK WITH THE THREE HUNDRED TALERS AT HOME THE SMALL PEASANT GRADUALLY LAUNCHED OUT HE BUILT A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND THE PEASANTS SAID THE SMALL PEASANT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN TO THE PLACE WHERE GOLDEN SNOW FALLS
458-126305-0026 AND PEOPLE CARRY THE GOLD HOME IN SHOVELS THEN THE SMALL PEASANT WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE MAYOR AND BIDDEN TO SAY FROM WHENCE HIS WEALTH CAME HE ANSWERED I SOLD MY COW'S SKIN IN THE TOWN FOR THREE HUNDRED TALERS WHEN THE PEASANTS HEARD THAT THEY TOO WISHED TO ENJOY THIS GREAT PROFIT
458-126305-0027 AND RAN HOME KILLED ALL THEIR COWS AND STRIPPED OFF THEIR SKINS IN ORDER TO SELL THEM IN THE TOWN TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE THE MAYOR HOWEVER SAID BUT MY SERVANT MUST GO FIRST
458-126305-0028 AND WHEN THE OTHERS CAME HE DID NOT GIVE THEM SO MUCH AND SAID WHAT CAN I DO WITH ALL THESE SKINS THEN THE PEASANTS WERE VEXED THAT THE SMALL PEASANT SHOULD HAVE THUS OUTWITTED THEM WANTED TO TAKE VENGEANCE ON HIM AND ACCUSED HIM OF THIS TREACHERY BEFORE THE MAYOR
458-126305-0029 THE INNOCENT LITTLE PEASANT WAS UNANIMOUSLY SENTENCED TO DEATH AND WAS TO BE ROLLED INTO THE WATER IN A BARREL PIERCED FULL OF HOLES HE WAS LED FORTH AND A PRIEST WAS BROUGHT WHO WAS TO SAY A MASS FOR HIS SOUL
458-126305-0030 THE OTHERS WERE ALL OBLIGED TO RETIRE TO A DISTANCE AND WHEN THE PEASANT LOOKED AT THE PRIEST HE RECOGNIZED THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE MILLER'S WIFE HE SAID TO HIM I SET YOU FREE FROM THE CLOSET SET ME FREE FROM THE BARREL AT THIS SAME MOMENT UP CAME
458-126305-0031 WITH A FLOCK OF SHEEP THE VERY SHEPHERD WHOM THE PEASANT KNEW HAD LONG BEEN WISHING TO BE MAYOR
458-126305-0032 NO I WILL NOT DO IT IF THE WHOLE WORLD INSISTS ON IT I WILL NOT DO IT THE SHEPHERD HEARING THAT CAME UP TO HIM AND ASKED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WILL NOT DO THE PEASANT SAID THEY WANT TO MAKE ME MAYOR
458-126305-0033 MYSELF IN THE BARREL BUT I WILL NOT DO IT THE SHEPHERD SAID
458-126305-0034 I WOULD GET INTO THE BARREL AT ONCE
458-126305-0035 YOU WILL BE MAYOR THE SHEPHERD WAS WILLING AND GOT IN AND THE PEASANT SHUT THE TOP DOWN ON HIM
458-126305-0036 THE PARSON WENT TO THE CROWD AND DECLARED THAT THE MASS HAD BEEN SAID THEN THEY CAME AND ROLLED THE BARREL TOWARDS THE WATER WHEN THE BARREL BEGAN TO ROLL THE SHEPHERD CRIED I AM QUITE WILLING TO BE MAYOR THEY BELIEVED NO OTHERWISE
458-126305-0037 THAN THAT IT WAS THE PEASANT WHO WAS SAYING THIS AND ANSWERED THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND BUT FIRST YOU SHALL LOOK ABOUT YOU A LITTLE DOWN BELOW THERE AND THEY ROLLED THE BARREL DOWN INTO THE WATER AFTER THAT THE PEASANTS WENT HOME
458-126305-0038 AND AS THEY WERE ENTERING THE VILLAGE THE SMALL PEASANT ALSO CAME QUIETLY IN DRIVING A FLOCK OF SHEEP AND LOOKING QUITE CONTENTED THEN THE PEASANTS WERE ASTONISHED AND SAID PEASANT FROM WHENCE DO YOU COME HAVE YOU COME OUT OF THE WATER YES TRULY REPLIED THE PEASANT
458-126305-0039 I SANK DEEP DEEP DOWN UNTIL AT LAST I GOT TO THE BOTTOM
458-126305-0040 OUT OF THE BARREL AND CREPT OUT AND THERE WERE PRETTY MEADOWS ON WHICH A NUMBER OF LAMBS WERE FEEDING AND FROM THENCE I BROUGHT THIS FLOCK AWAY WITH ME SAID THE PEASANTS ARE THERE ANY MORE THERE
458-126305-0041 THEN THE PEASANTS MADE UP THEIR MINDS THAT THEY TOO WOULD FETCH SOME SHEEP FOR THEMSELVES A FLOCK APIECE BUT THE MAYOR SAID I COME FIRST SO THEY WENT TO THE WATER TOGETHER
458-126305-0042 WHEREUPON THE PEASANTS CRIED WE ALREADY SEE THE SHEEP DOWN BELOW THE MAYOR PRESSED FORWARD AND SAID I WILL GO DOWN FIRST AND LOOK ABOUT ME AND IF THINGS PROMISE WELL I'LL CALL YOU
460-172357-0000 I KNOW NO WAY IN WHICH A WRITER MAY MORE FITTINGLY INTRODUCE HIS WORK TO THE PUBLIC THAN BY GIVING A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHO AND WHAT HE IS BY THIS MEANS SOME OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE IS VERY PROPERLY SHIFTED TO THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS LIFE
460-172357-0001 MY PARENTS MIGRATED TO CANADA IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I DECIDED TO GO WITH THEM MY FATHER TOOK UP A FARM NEAR LAKE SIMCOE IN ONTARIO THIS WAS DURING THE HARD TIMES OF CANADIAN FARMING
460-172357-0002 AND MY FATHER WAS JUST ABLE BY GREAT DILIGENCE TO PAY THE HIRED MEN AND IN YEARS OF PLENTY TO RAISE ENOUGH GRAIN TO HAVE SEED FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S CROP WITHOUT BUYING ANY BY THIS PROCESS MY BROTHERS AND I WERE INEVITABLY DRIVEN OFF THE LAND
460-172357-0003 THAT IS INDUCED BY HONEST MANUAL TOIL I WAS EDUCATED AT UPPER CANADA COLLEGE TORONTO OF WHICH I WAS HEAD BOY IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FROM THERE I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO WHERE I GRADUATED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE
460-172357-0004 AT THE UNIVERSITY I SPENT MY ENTIRE TIME IN THE ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGES LIVING DEAD AND HALF DEAD AND KNEW NOTHING OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN THIS DILIGENT PURSUIT OF WORDS I SPENT ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS OF EACH DAY
460-172357-0005 IN OTHER WORDS I WAS WHAT IS CALLED A DISTINGUISHED GRADUATE AND AS SUCH I TOOK TO SCHOOL TEACHING AS THE ONLY TRADE I COULD FIND THAT NEED NEITHER EXPERIENCE NOR INTELLECT I SPENT MY TIME FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE TO EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE ON THE STAFF OF UPPER CANADA COLLEGE
460-172357-0006 AN EXPERIENCE WHICH HAS LEFT ME WITH A PROFOUND SYMPATHY FOR THE MANY GIFTED AND BRILLIANT MEN WHO ARE COMPELLED TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN THE MOST DREARY THE MOST THANKLESS AND THE WORST PAID PROFESSION IN THE WORLD
460-172357-0007 AND BY MEANS OF THIS AND SOME TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT BY MC GILL UNIVERSITY I SURVIVED UNTIL I TOOK THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN NINETEEN O THREE THE MEANING OF THIS DEGREE IS THAT THE RECIPIENT OF INSTRUCTION IS EXAMINED FOR THE LAST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND IS PRONOUNCED COMPLETELY FULL
460-172357-0008 AFTER THIS NO NEW IDEAS CAN BE IMPARTED TO HIM FROM THIS TIME AND SINCE MY MARRIAGE WHICH HAD OCCURRED AT THIS PERIOD I HAVE BELONGED TO THE STAFF OF MC GILL UNIVERSITY FIRST AS LECTURER IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LATER AS HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
460-172357-0009 I AM ABLE TO REGARD MYSELF AS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE THE EMOLUMENT IS SO HIGH AS TO PLACE ME DISTINCTLY ABOVE THE POLICEMEN POSTMEN STREET CAR CONDUCTORS AND OTHER SALARIED OFFICIALS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
460-172357-0010 WHILE I AM ABLE TO MIX WITH THE POORER OF THE BUSINESS MEN OF THE CITY ON TERMS OF SOMETHING LIKE EQUALITY IN POINT OF LEISURE I ENJOY MORE IN THE FOUR CORNERS OF A SINGLE YEAR THAN A BUSINESS MAN KNOWS IN HIS WHOLE LIFE I THUS HAVE WHAT THE BUSINESS MAN CAN NEVER ENJOY
460-172357-0011 AN ABILITY TO THINK AND WHAT IS STILL BETTER TO STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER FOR MONTHS AT A TIME I HAVE WRITTEN A NUMBER OF THINGS IN CONNECTION WITH MY COLLEGE LIFE A BOOK ON POLITICAL SCIENCE AND MANY ESSAYS MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND SO ON
460-172357-0012 A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT ALL ROUND THE BRITISH EMPIRE DELIVERING ADDRESSES ON IMPERIAL ORGANIZATION WHEN I STATE THAT THESE LECTURES WERE FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA THE BANANA RIOTS IN TRINIDAD AND THE TURCO ITALIAN WAR
460-172357-0013 NOR TO CONSTRUCT EVEN THE SMALLEST SECTION OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY THIS HOWEVER IS A FORM OF NATIONAL INGRATITUDE TO WHICH ONE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED IN THIS DOMINION APART FROM MY COLLEGE WORK I HAVE WRITTEN TWO BOOKS ONE CALLED LITERARY LAPSES
460-172357-0014 AND THE OTHER NONSENSE NOVELS EACH OF THESE IS PUBLISHED BY JOHN LANE LONDON AND NEW YORK AND EITHER OF THEM CAN BE OBTAINED ABSURD THOUGH IT SOUNDS FOR THE MERE SUM OF THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE ANY READER OF THIS PREFACE FOR EXAMPLE RIDICULOUS THOUGH IT APPEARS
460-172357-0015 COULD WALK INTO A BOOKSTORE AND BUY BOTH OF THESE BOOKS FOR SEVEN SHILLINGS YET THESE WORKS ARE OF SO HUMOROUS A CHARACTER THAT FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO PRINT THEM THE COMPOSITORS FELL BACK FROM THEIR TASK SUFFOCATED WITH LAUGHTER AND GASPING FOR AIR
460-172357-0016 MANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WRITE THESE HUMOROUS NOTHINGS IN IDLE MOMENTS WHEN THE WEARIED BRAIN IS UNABLE TO PERFORM THE SERIOUS LABOURS OF THE ECONOMIST MY OWN EXPERIENCE IS EXACTLY THE OTHER WAY
460-172357-0017 BUT TO WRITE SOMETHING OUT OF ONE'S OWN MIND WORTH READING FOR ITS OWN SAKE IS AN ARDUOUS CONTRIVANCE ONLY TO BE ACHIEVED IN FORTUNATE MOMENTS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
460-172357-0018 IN REGARD TO THE PRESENT WORK I MUST DISCLAIM AT ONCE ALL INTENTIONS OF TRYING TO DO ANYTHING SO RIDICULOUSLY EASY AS WRITING ABOUT A REAL PLACE AND REAL PEOPLE MARIPOSA IS NOT A REAL TOWN ON THE CONTRARY IT IS ABOUT SEVENTY OR EIGHTY OF THEM
460-172357-0019 YOU MAY FIND THEM ALL THE WAY FROM LAKE SUPERIOR TO THE SEA WITH THE SAME SQUARE STREETS AND THE SAME MAPLE TREES AND THE SAME CHURCHES AND HOTELS AND EVERYWHERE THE SUNSHINE OF THE LAND OF HOPE SIMILARLY THE REVEREND MISTER DRONE IS NOT ONE PERSON BUT ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN
460-172357-0020 TO MAKE HIM I CLAPPED THE GAITERS OF ONE ECCLESIASTIC ROUND THE LEGS OF ANOTHER ADDED THE SERMONS OF A THIRD AND THE CHARACTER OF A FOURTH AND SO LET HIM START ON HIS WAY IN THE BOOK TO PICK UP SUCH INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES AS HE MIGHT FIND FOR HIMSELF
460-172357-0021 MULLINS AND BAGSHAW AND JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH AND THE REST ARE IT IS TRUE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE BUT I HAVE KNOWN THEM IN SUCH A VARIETY OF FORMS WITH SUCH ALTERNATIONS OF TALL AND SHORT DARK AND FAIR THAT INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD HAVE MUCH ADO TO KNOW THEM
460-172357-0022 AND NEEDS A TELLER AS FOR MISTER SMITH WITH HIS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY POUNDS HIS HOARSE VOICE HIS LOUD CHECK SUIT
460-172357-0023 ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY TO BE A NECESSARY AND UNIVERSAL ADJUNCT OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS THE INSPIRATION OF THE BOOK
460-172357-0024 A LAND OF HOPE AND SUNSHINE WHERE LITTLE TOWNS SPREAD THEIR SQUARE STREETS AND THEIR TRIM MAPLE TREES BESIDE PLACID LAKES ALMOST WITHIN ECHO OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST IS LARGE ENOUGH
460-172357-0025 THE FAULT LIES RATHER WITH AN ART THAT IS DEFICIENT THAN IN AN AFFECTION THAT IS WANTING
460-172359-0000 IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
460-172359-0001 THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
460-172359-0002 AS GRAVE AS AN OPERATING SURGEON THEN AS I THINK I SAID MISTER SMITH CAME IN EVERY MORNING AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF FLORIDA WATER AND RUMS ESSENCES AND REVIVERS AND RENOVATORS REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE
460-172359-0003 WHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
460-172359-0004 TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0005 EVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEED
460-172359-0006 IN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT
460-172359-0007 I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
460-172359-0008 WITH A FALSE FRONT THAT STICKS UP ABOVE ITS REAL HEIGHT AND GIVES IT AN AIR AT ONCE RECTANGULAR AND IMPOSING IT IS A FORM OF ARCHITECTURE MUCH USED IN MARIPOSA AND UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRETENTIOUS AND ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF MODERN BUSINESS
460-172359-0009 AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0010 THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
460-172359-0011 AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR IT SETS IN VIOLENT AGITATION A COILED SPRING UP ABOVE AND A BELL THAT ALMOST RINGS INSIDE THERE ARE TWO SHAVING CHAIRS OF THE HEAVIER OR ELECTROCUTION PATTERN
460-172359-0012 IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
460-172359-0013 ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
460-172359-0014 THEY SAID COMMONLY IN MARIPOSA THAT JEFF MADE MONEY OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP HE MAY HAVE AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THAT TURNED HIS MIND TO INVESTMENT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD A SHAVE COST FIVE CENTS AND A HAIR CUT FIFTEEN OR THE TWO IF YOU LIKED FOR A QUARTER
460-172359-0015 AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
460-172359-0016 AND THEN IN THE OTHER YOU SEE IN MARIPOSA SHAVING ISN'T THE HURRIED PERFUNCTORY THING THAT IT IS IN THE CITY A SHAVE IS LOOKED UPON AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND LASTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE MORNING HOURS PERHAPS THERE WAS A SEMBLANCE OF HASTE ABOUT IT
460-172359-0017 THE RAZOR WOULD GO SLOWER AND SLOWER AND PAUSE AND STOP MOVE AND PAUSE AGAIN TILL THE SHAVE DIED AWAY INTO THE MERE DROWSE OF CONVERSATION AT SUCH HOURS THE MARIPOSA BARBER SHOP WOULD BECOME A VERY PALACE OF SLUMBER
460-172359-0018 AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
460-172359-0019 YOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATION
460-172359-0020 WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
460-172359-0021 THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH
460-172359-0022 AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
460-172359-0023 THERE WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN THAT JEFF WOULD SIZE UP SIDEWAYS AS HE STROPPED THE RAZOR AND IN WHOSE EAR HE WOULD WHISPER I SEE WHERE SAINT LOUIS HAS TOOK FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES OFF CHICAGO AND SO HOLD HIM FASCINATED TO THE END IN THE SAME WAY HE WOULD SAY TO MISTER SMITH
460-172359-0024 I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
460-172359-0025 THE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSED
