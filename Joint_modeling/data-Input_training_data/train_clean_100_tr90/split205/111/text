4340-15220-0068 AS HE LOOKED BEFORE HE LEAPED HE BEHELD A SIGHT WHICH CAUSED HIM TO STARE WITH ALL HIS MIGHT FOR AN INSTANT THEN TURN AND BECKON SAYING IN AN EAGER WHISPER
4340-15220-0069 AND BOTH SUPPRESSED AN ASTONISHED HULLO FOR THERE STOOD BAB WAITING FOR SANCHO TO LAP HIS FILL OUT OF THE OVERFLOWING TROUGH SUCH A SHABBY TIRED LOOKING COUPLE AS THEY WERE
4340-15220-0070 BAB WITH A FACE AS RED AS A LOBSTER AND STREAKED WITH TEARS SHOES WHITE WITH DUST PLAYFROCK TORN AT THE GATHERS SOMETHING BUNDLED UP IN HER APRON AND ONE SHOE DOWN AT THE HEEL AS IF IT HURT HER
4340-15220-0071 SANCHO LAPPED EAGERLY WITH HIS EYES SHUT ALL HIS RUFFLES WERE GRAY WITH DUST AND HIS TAIL HUNG WEARILY DOWN THE TASSEL AT HALF MAST AS IF IN MOURNING FOR THE MASTER WHOM HE HAD COME TO FIND
4340-15220-0072 BAB STILL HELD THE STRAP INTENT ON KEEPING HER CHARGE SAFE THOUGH SHE LOST HERSELF BUT HER COURAGE SEEMED TO BE GIVING OUT AS SHE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY UP AND DOWN THE ROAD
4340-15220-0073 SEEING NO SIGN OF THE THREE FAMILIAR FIGURES SHE HAD BEEN FOLLOWING AS STEADILY AS A LITTLE INDIAN ON THE WAR TRAIL OH SANCH WHAT SHALL I DO IF THEY DON'T COME ALONG WE MUST HAVE GONE BY THEM SOMEWHERE FOR I DON'T SEE ANY ONE THAT WAY

4340-15220-0076 TRYING TO PULL HIM AFTER HER AS SHE TRUDGED ON BOUND TO SEE THE OUTSIDE OF THAT WONDERFUL TENT EVEN IF SHE NEVER GOT IN BUT SANCHO HAD HEARD A SOFT CHIRRUP AND WITH A SUDDEN BOUND TWITCHED THE STRAP AWAY SPRANG UP THE BANK
4340-15220-0077 AND LANDED DIRECTLY ON BEN'S BACK AS HE LAY PEEPING OVER A PEAL OF LAUGHTER GREETED HIM AND HAVING GOT THE BETTER OF HIS MASTER IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE HE MADE THE MOST OF THE ADVANTAGE BY PLAYFULLY WORRYING HIM AS HE KEPT HIM DOWN
4340-15220-0078 LICKING HIS FACE IN SPITE OF HIS STRUGGLES BURROWING IN HIS NECK WITH A TICKLISH NOSE SNAPPING AT HIS BUTTONS AND YELPING JOYFULLY AS IF IT WAS THE BEST JOKE IN THE WORLD TO PLAY HIDE AND SEEK FOR FOUR LONG MILES
4340-15220-0079 BEFORE BEN COULD QUIET HIM BAB CAME CLIMBING UP THE BANK WITH SUCH A FUNNY MIXTURE OF FEAR FATIGUE DETERMINATION AND RELIEF IN HER DIRTY LITTLE FACE
4340-15220-0080 THAT THE BOYS COULD NOT LOOK AWFUL IF THEY TRIED HOW DARED YOU COME AFTER US MISS DEMANDED SAM AS SHE LOOKED CALMLY ABOUT HER AND TOOK A SEAT BEFORE SHE WAS ASKED SANCH WOULD COME AFTER BEN

4340-15220-0087 WAS THE PROMPT ANSWER BUT YOU HAVEN'T ANY MONEY OH I'D ASK SOMEBODY TO PAY FOR ME I M SO LITTLE IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH
4340-15220-0088 I THOUGHT OF THAT AND PLANNED HOW I'D FIX IT IF I DIDN'T FIND BEN I'D MAKE SANCH DO HIS TRICKS AND GET A QUARTER THAT WAY SO NOW ANSWERED BAB UNDAUNTED BY ANY OBSTACLE I DO BELIEVE SHE WOULD

4340-15220-0091 AND BOUND TO DO THE HANDSOME THING BY HIS PERSISTENT FRIEND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD AND BAB FOLDED HER ARMS AS IF SHE HAD NOTHING FURTHER TO DO BUT ENJOY HERSELF ARE YOU HUNGRY ASKED BILLY
4340-15220-0092 FISHING OUT SEVERAL FRAGMENTS OF GINGERBREAD STARVING AND BAB ATE THEM WITH SUCH A RELISH THAT SAM ADDED A SMALL CONTRIBUTION AND BEN CAUGHT SOME WATER FOR HER IN HIS HAND WHERE THE LITTLE SPRING BUBBLED UP BESIDE A STONE NOW
4340-15220-0093 COMMANDED BEN GIVING SANCH A ROLL ON THE GRASS TO CLEAN HIM BAB SCRUBBED HER FACE TILL IT SHONE AND PULLING DOWN HER APRON TO WIPE IT SCATTERED A LOAD OF TREASURES COLLECTED IN HER WALK SOME OF THE DEAD FLOWERS
4340-15220-0094 BITS OF MOSS AND GREEN TWIGS FELL NEAR BEN AND ONE ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION A SPRAY OF BROAD SMOOTH LEAVES WITH A BUNCH OF WHITISH BERRIES ON IT WHERE DID YOU GET THAT HE ASKED POKING IT WITH HIS FOOT
4340-15220-0095 IN A SWAMPY PLACE COMING ALONG SANCH SAW SOMETHING DOWN THERE AND I WENT WITH HIM CAUSE I THOUGHT MAY BE IT WAS A MUSK RAT AND YOU'D LIKE ONE IF WE COULD GET HIM
4340-15220-0096 AND WITH INTENSE INTEREST NO ONLY A SNAKE AND I DON'T CARE FOR SNAKES I PICKED SOME OF THAT IT WAS SO GREEN AND PRETTY THORNY LIKES QUEER LEAVES AND BERRIES YOU KNOW ANSWERED BAB SPATTING DOWN HER ROUGH LOCKS
4340-15220-0097 WELL HE WON'T LIKE THAT NOR YOU EITHER
4340-15220-0098 AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU'D GOT POISONED BAB DON'T TOUCH IT
4340-15220-0099 AND BEN LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT BAB WHO FELT HER CHUBBY FACE ALL OVER AND EXAMINED HER DINGY HANDS WITH A SOLEMN AIR ASKING EAGERLY WILL IT BREAK OUT ON ME FORE I GET TO THE CIRCUS
4340-15220-0100 NOT FOR A DAY OR SO I GUESS BUT IT'S BAD WHEN IT DOES COME
4362-15663-0000 A PERILOUS NIGHT ON SHASTA'S SUMMIT TOWARD THE END OF SUMMER AFTER A LIGHT OPEN WINTER ONE MAY REACH THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT SHASTA WITHOUT PASSING OVER MUCH SNOW BY KEEPING ON THE CREST OF A LONG NARROW RIDGE
4362-15663-0001 MOSTLY BARE THAT EXTENDS FROM NEAR THE CAMP GROUND AT THE TIMBERLINE BUT ON MY FIRST EXCURSION TO THE SUMMIT THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO ITS LOW SWELLING BASE WAS SMOOTHLY LADEN WITH LOOSE FRESH SNOW
4362-15663-0002 PRESENTING A MOST GLORIOUS MASS OF WINTER MOUNTAIN SCENERY IN THE MIDST OF WHICH I SCRAMBLED AND REVELED OR LAY SNUGLY SNOWBOUND ENJOYING THE FERTILE CLOUDS AND THE SNOW BLOOM IN ALL THEIR GROWING DRIFTING GRANDEUR
4362-15663-0003 THE FIRST RAINS HAD FALLEN ON THE LOWLANDS AND THE FIRST SNOWS ON THE MOUNTAINS AND EVERYTHING WAS FRESH AND BRACING WHILE AN ABUNDANCE OF BALMY SUNSHINE FILLED ALL THE NOONDAY HOURS
4362-15663-0004 IT WAS THE CALM AFTERGLOW THAT USUALLY SUCCEEDS THE FIRST STORM OF THE WINTER I MET MANY OF THE BIRDS THAT HAD REARED THEIR YOUNG AND SPENT THEIR SUMMER IN THE SHASTA WOODS AND CHAPARRAL THEY WERE THEN ON THEIR WAY SOUTH TO THEIR WINTER HOMES
4362-15663-0005 LEADING THEIR YOUNG FULL FLEDGED AND ABOUT AS LARGE AND STRONG AS THE PARENTS SQUIRRELS DRY AND ELASTIC AFTER THE STORMS WERE BUSY ABOUT THEIR STORES OF PINE NUTS AND THE LATEST GOLDENRODS WERE STILL IN BLOOM THOUGH IT WAS NOW PAST THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER
4362-15663-0006 THE GRAND COLOR GLOW THE AUTUMNAL JUBILEE OF RIPE LEAVES WAS PAST PRIME BUT FRESHENED BY THE RAIN WAS STILL MAKING A FINE SHOW ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER AND IN THE RAVINES AND THE DELLS OF THE SMALLER STREAMS
4362-15663-0007 AT THE SALMON HATCHING ESTABLISHMENT ON THE MC CLOUD RIVER I HALTED A WEEK TO EXAMINE THE LIMESTONE BELT GRANDLY DEVELOPED THERE TO LEARN WHAT I COULD OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE RIVER AND ITS BANKS
4362-15663-0008 AND TO GIVE TIME FOR THE FRESH SNOW THAT I KNEW HAD FALLEN ON THE MOUNTAIN TO SETTLE SOMEWHAT WITH A VIEW TO MAKING THE ASCENT A PEDESTRIAN ON THESE MOUNTAIN ROADS ESPECIALLY SO LATE IN THE YEAR IS SURE TO EXCITE CURIOSITY
4362-15663-0009 AND MANY WERE THE INTERROGATIONS CONCERNING MY RAMBLE WHEN I SAID THAT I WAS SIMPLY TAKING A WALK AND THAT ICY SHASTA WAS MY MARK I WAS INVARIABLY ADMONISHED THAT I HAD COME ON A DANGEROUS QUEST THE TIME WAS FAR TOO LATE
4362-15663-0010 THE SNOW WAS TOO LOOSE AND DEEP TO CLIMB AND I SHOULD BE LOST IN DRIFTS AND SLIDES WHEN I HINTED THAT NEW SNOW WAS BEAUTIFUL AND STORMS NOT SO BAD AS THEY WERE CALLED MY ADVISERS SHOOK THEIR HEADS IN TOKEN OF SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
4362-15663-0011 AND DECLARED THE ASCENT OF SHASTA BUTTE THROUGH LOOSE SNOW IMPOSSIBLE NEVERTHELESS BEFORE NOON OF THE SECOND OF NOVEMBER I WAS IN THE FROSTY AZURE OF THE UTMOST SUMMIT WHEN I ARRIVED AT SISSON'S EVERYTHING WAS QUIET
4362-15663-0012 AND I WAS IN HASTE TO BE OFF AND GET MYSELF ESTABLISHED SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDST OF IT WHETHER THE SUMMIT WAS TO BE ATTAINED OR NOT SISSON WHO IS A MOUNTAINEER SPEEDILY FITTED ME OUT FOR STORM OR CALM AS ONLY A MOUNTAINEER COULD
4362-15663-0013 AND THE FROSTS AND THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING SO LATE IN THE YEAR THEREFORE I COULD NOT ASK A GUIDE TO GO WITH ME EVEN HAD ONE BEEN WILLING ALL I WANTED WAS TO HAVE BLANKETS AND PROVISIONS DEPOSITED AS FAR UP IN THE TIMBER AS THE SNOW WOULD PERMIT A PACK ANIMAL TO GO
4362-15663-0014 THERE I COULD BUILD A STORM NEST AND LIE WARM AND MAKE RAIDS UP AND AROUND THE MOUNTAIN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WEATHER SETTING OUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER FIRST WITH JEROME FAY MOUNTAINEER AND GUIDE IN CHARGE OF THE ANIMALS
4362-15663-0015 THE SNOW OF COURSE GROWING STEADILY DEEPER AND LOOSER SO THAT WE HAD TO BREAK A TRAIL THE ANIMALS BEGAN TO GET DISCOURAGED AND AFTER NIGHT AND DARKNESS CAME ON THEY BECAME ENTANGLED IN A BED OF ROUGH LAVA
4362-15663-0016 WHERE BREAKING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE FEET OF MEALY SNOW THEIR FEET WERE CAUGHT BETWEEN ANGULAR BOULDERS HERE THEY WERE IN DANGER OF BEING LOST BUT AFTER WE HAD REMOVED PACKS AND SADDLES AND ASSISTED THEIR EFFORTS WITH ROPES
4362-15663-0017 THEY ALL ESCAPED TO THE SIDE OF A RIDGE ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE TIMBERLINE TO GO FARTHER WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION SO WE WERE COMPELLED TO CAMP AS BEST WE COULD A PITCH PINE FIRE SPEEDILY CHANGED THE TEMPERATURE
4362-15663-0018 AND SHED A BLAZE OF LIGHT ON THE WILD LAVA SLOPE AND THE STRAGGLING STORM BENT PINES AROUND US MELTED SNOW ANSWERED FOR COFFEE AND WE HAD PLENTY OF VENISON TO ROAST TOWARD MIDNIGHT I ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS SLEPT AN HOUR AND A HALF
4362-15663-0019 AND INDICATED THE WAY AS WELL AS HE COULD IN THE DARKNESS HE SEEMED LOATH TO LEAVE ME BUT BEING REASSURED THAT I WAS AT HOME AND REQUIRED NO CARE HE BADE ME GOOD BYE AND RETURNED TO CAMP READY TO LEAD HIS ANIMALS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AT DAYBREAK
4362-15663-0020 ALONE IN THE SOLEMN SILENCE OF THE NIGHT HALF THE SKY WAS CLOUDED IN THE OTHER HALF THE STARS SPARKLED ICILY IN THE KEEN FROSTY AIR WHILE EVERYWHERE THE GLORIOUS WEALTH OF SNOW
4362-15663-0021 FELL AWAY FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE IN FLOWING FOLDS MORE EXTENSIVE AND CONTINUOUS THAN ANY I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE WHEN DAY DAWNED THE CLOUDS WERE CRAWLING SLOWLY AND BECOMING MORE MASSIVE BUT GAVE NO INTIMATION OF IMMEDIATE DANGER
4362-15663-0022 IN BLANK EXPOSURE TO THE DEEP UPPER CURRENTS OF THE SKY AND NO LABYRINTH OF PEAKS AND CANYONS I HAD EVER BEEN IN SEEMED TO ME SO DANGEROUS AS THESE IMMENSE SLOPES BARE AGAINST THE SKY
4362-15663-0023 THE FROST WAS INTENSE AND DRIFTING SNOW DUST MADE BREATHING AT TIMES RATHER DIFFICULT THE SNOW WAS AS DRY AS MEAL AND THE FINER PARTICLES DRIFTED FREELY RISING HIGH IN THE AIR WHILE THE LARGER PORTIONS OF THE CRYSTALS ROLLED LIKE SAND
4362-15663-0024 I FREQUENTLY SANK TO MY ARMPITS BETWEEN BURIED BLOCKS OF LOOSE LAVA BUT GENERALLY ONLY TO MY KNEES WHEN TIRED WITH WALKING I STILL WALLOWED SLOWLY UPWARD ON ALL FOURS THE STEEPNESS OF THE SLOPE
4362-15663-0025 THIRTY FIVE DEGREES IN SOME PLACES MADE ANY KIND OF PROGRESS FATIGUING WHILE SMALL AVALANCHES WERE BEING CONSTANTLY SET IN MOTION IN THE STEEPEST PLACES BUT THE BRACING AIR AND THE SUBLIME BEAUTY OF THE SNOWY EXPANSE
4362-15663-0026 THRILLED EVERY NERVE AND MADE ABSOLUTE EXHAUSTION IMPOSSIBLE I SEEMED TO BE WALKING AND WALLOWING IN A CLOUD BUT HOLDING STEADILY ONWARD BY HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK I HAD GAINED THE HIGHEST SUMMIT
4362-15663-0027 I HELD MY COMMANDING FOOTHOLD IN THE SKY FOR TWO HOURS GAZING ON THE GLORIOUS LANDSCAPES SPREAD MAPLIKE AROUND THE IMMENSE HORIZON AND TRACING THE OUTLINES OF THE ANCIENT LAVA STREAMS EXTENDING FAR INTO THE SURROUNDING PLAINS
4362-15663-0028 AND THE PATHWAYS OF VANISHED GLACIERS OF WHICH SHASTA HAD BEEN THE CENTER BUT AS I HAD LEFT MY COAT IN CAMP FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING MY LIMBS FREE IN CLIMBING I SOON WAS COLD THE WIND INCREASED IN VIOLENCE
4362-15663-0029 RAISING THE SNOW IN MAGNIFICENT DRIFTS THAT WERE DRAWN OUT IN THE FORM OF WAVERING BANNERS BLOWING IN THE SUN TOWARD THE END OF MY STAY A SUCCESSION OF SMALL CLOUDS STRUCK AGAINST THE SUMMIT ROCKS LIKE DRIFTING ICEBERGS
4362-15663-0030 DARKENING THE AIR AS THEY PASSED AND PRODUCING A CHILL AS DEFINITE AND SUDDEN AS IF ICE WATER HAD BEEN DASHED IN MY FACE THIS IS THE KIND OF CLOUD IN WHICH SNOW FLOWERS GROW AND I TURNED AND FLED
4362-15663-0031 I REACHED CAMP ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE DUSK HOLLOWED A STRIP OF LOOSE GROUND IN THE LEE OF A LARGE BLOCK OF RED LAVA WHERE FIREWOOD WAS ABUNDANT ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS AND WENT TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING
4362-15663-0032 HAVING SLEPT LITTLE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ASCENT AND BEING WEARY WITH CLIMBING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT WAS OVER I SLEPT LATE THEN AWAKING SUDDENLY MY EYES OPENED ON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SUBLIME SCENES I EVER ENJOYED A BOUNDLESS WILDERNESS OF STORM CLOUDS
4362-15663-0033 UNDULATING HILL AND DALE SMOOTH PURPLE PLAINS AND SILVERY MOUNTAINS OF CUMULI RANGE OVER RANGE DIVERSIFIED WITH PEAK AND DOME AND HOLLOW FULLY BROUGHT OUT IN LIGHT AND SHADE I GAZED ENCHANTED
4362-15663-0034 BUT COLD GRAY MASSES DRIFTING LIKE DUST ON A WIND SWEPT PLAIN BEGAN TO SHUT OUT THE LIGHT FORERUNNERS OF THE COMING STORM I HAD BEEN SO ANXIOUSLY WATCHING I MADE HASTE TO GATHER AS MUCH WOOD AS POSSIBLE
4362-15663-0035 THE STORM SIDE OF MY BLANKETS WAS FASTENED DOWN WITH STAKES TO REDUCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE SIFTING IN OF DRIFT AND THE DANGER OF BEING BLOWN AWAY THE PRECIOUS BREAD SACK WAS PLACED SAFELY AS A PILLOW AND WHEN AT LENGTH THE FIRST FLAKES FELL
4362-15663-0036 I WAS EXULTINGLY READY TO WELCOME THEM MOST OF MY FIREWOOD WAS MORE THAN HALF ROSIN AND WOULD BLAZE IN THE FACE OF THE FIERCEST DRIFTING THE WINDS COULD NOT DEMOLISH MY BED AND MY BREAD COULD BE MADE TO LAST INDEFINITELY
4362-15663-0037 WHILE IN CASE OF NEED I HAD THE MEANS OF MAKING SNOWSHOES AND COULD RETREAT OR HOLD MY GROUND AS I PLEASED PRESENTLY THE STORM BROKE FORTH INTO FULL SNOWY BLOOM AND THE THRONGING CRYSTALS DARKENED THE AIR
4362-15663-0038 THE WIND SWEPT PAST IN HISSING FLOODS GRINDING THE SNOW INTO MEAL AND SWEEPING DOWN INTO THE HOLLOWS IN ENORMOUS DRIFTS ALL THE HEAVIER PARTICLES WHILE THE FINER DUST WAS SIFTED THROUGH THE SKY INCREASING THE ICY GLOOM
4362-15663-0039 AND THE PASSIONATE UPROAR PRODUCED A GLAD EXCITEMENT DAY AFTER DAY THE STORM CONTINUED PILING SNOW ON SNOW IN WEARILESS ABUNDANCE
4362-15663-0040 AS IF TO KNOW HOW THE WORK WAS ADVANCING DURING THESE CALM INTERVALS I REPLENISHED MY FIRE SOMETIMES WITHOUT LEAVING THE NEST FOR FIRE AND WOODPILE WERE SO NEAR THIS COULD EASILY BE DONE OR BUSIED MYSELF WITH MY NOTEBOOK
4362-15663-0041 WATCHING THE GESTURES OF THE TREES IN TAKING THE SNOW EXAMINING SEPARATE CRYSTALS UNDER A LENS AND LEARNING THE METHODS OF THEIR DEPOSITION AS AN ENDURING FOUNTAIN FOR THE STREAMS SEVERAL TIMES WHEN THE STORM CEASED FOR A FEW MINUTES
4362-15663-0042 A DOUGLAS SQUIRREL CAME FRISKING FROM THE FOOT OF A CLUMP OF DWARF PINES MOVING IN SUDDEN INTERRUPTED SPURTS OVER THE BOSSY SNOW THEN WITHOUT ANY APPARENT GUIDANCE HE WOULD DIG RAPIDLY INTO THE DRIFT WHERE WERE BURIED SOME GRAINS OF BARLEY THAT THE HORSES HAD LEFT
4362-15663-0043 THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL DOES NOT STRICTLY BELONG TO THESE UPPER WOODS AND I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM OUT IN SUCH WEATHER THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP ALSO QUITE A LARGE FLOCK OF THEM CAME TO MY CAMP AND TOOK SHELTER BESIDE A CLUMP OF MATTED DWARF PINES
4362-15663-0044 AND HE MUST SURELY HAVE PERISHED AND SISSON WAS BLAMED FOR ALLOWING ANY ONE TO ATTEMPT CLIMBING IN SUCH WEATHER WHILE I WAS AS SAFE AS ANYBODY IN THE LOWLANDS LYING LIKE A SQUIRREL IN A WARM FLUFFY NEST BUSIED ABOUT MY OWN AFFAIRS AND WISHING ONLY TO BE LET ALONE
4362-15663-0045 I SAW AND FELT STILL MORE OF THE SHASTA SNOW FOR THEN IT WAS MY FORTUNE TO GET INTO THE VERY HEART OF A STORM AND TO BE HELD IN IT FOR A LONG TIME ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE
4362-15663-0046 THE DAY INTERVENING BETWEEN THE TWO ASCENTS BEING DEVOTED TO ESTABLISHING A CAMP ON THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE TIMBERLINE HERE ON OUR RED TRACHYTE BED WE OBTAINED TWO HOURS OF SHALLOW SLEEP BROKEN FOR OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF THE KEEN STARRY NIGHT
4362-15663-0047 AT TWO O'CLOCK WE ROSE BREAKFASTED ON A WARMED TIN CUPFUL OF COFFEE AND A PIECE OF FROZEN VENISON BROILED ON THE COALS AND STARTED FOR THE SUMMIT UP TO THIS TIME THERE WAS NOTHING IN SIGHT THAT BETOKENED THE APPROACH OF A STORM
4362-15663-0048 BUT ON GAINING THE SUMMIT WE SAW TOWARD LASSEN'S BUTTE HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES OF WHITE CUMULI BOILING DREAMILY IN THE SUNSHINE FAR BENEATH US AND CAUSING NO ALARM THE SLIGHT WEARINESS OF THE ASCENT WAS SOON RESTED AWAY
4362-15663-0049 AND OUR GLORIOUS MORNING IN THE SKY PROMISED NOTHING BUT ENJOYMENT AT NINE A M THE DRY THERMOMETER STOOD AT THIRTY FOUR DEGREES IN THE SHADE AND ROSE STEADILY UNTIL AT ONE P M IT STOOD AT FIFTY DEGREES
4362-15663-0050 PROBABLY INFLUENCED SOMEWHAT BY RADIATION FROM THE SUN WARMED CLIFFS A COMMON BUMBLEBEE NOT AT ALL BENUMBED ZIGZAGGED VIGOROUSLY ABOUT OUR HEADS FOR A FEW MOMENTS AS IF UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THE NEAREST HONEY FLOWER WAS A MILE BENEATH HIM
4362-15663-0051 IN THE MEAN TIME CLOUDS WERE GROWING DOWN IN SHASTA VALLEY MASSIVE SWELLING CUMULI DISPLAYING DELICIOUS TONES OF PURPLE AND GRAY IN THE HOLLOWS OF THEIR SUN BEATEN BOSSES EXTENDING GRADUALLY SOUTHWARD AROUND ON BOTH SIDES OF SHASTA
4362-15663-0052 THESE AT LENGTH UNITED WITH THE OLDER FIELD TOWARDS LASSEN'S BUTTE THUS ENCIRCLING MOUNT SHASTA IN ONE CONTINUOUS CLOUD ZONE RHETT AND KLAMATH LAKES WERE ECLIPSED BENEATH CLOUDS SCARCELY LESS BRILLIANT THAN THEIR OWN SILVERY DISKS
4362-15663-0053 THE MODOC LAVA BEDS MANY A SNOW LADEN PEAK FAR NORTH IN OREGON THE SCOTT AND TRINITY AND SISKIYOU MOUNTAINS THE PEAKS OF THE SIERRA THE BLUE COAST RANGE SHASTA VALLEY THE DARK FORESTS FILLING THE VALLEY OF THE SACRAMENTO
4362-15663-0054 THE CREATIVE SUN SHONE GLORIOUS ON THE VAST EXPANSE OF CLOUDLAND HILL AND DALE MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY SPRINGING INTO EXISTENCE RESPONSIVE TO HIS RAYS AND STEADILY DEVELOPING IN BEAUTY AND INDIVIDUALITY
4362-15663-0055 ON THE CONTRARY THEY IMPRESSED ONE AS BEING LASTING ADDITIONS TO THE LANDSCAPE THE WEATHER OF THE SPRINGTIME AND SUMMER THROUGHOUT THE SIERRA IN GENERAL IS USUALLY VARIED BY SLIGHT LOCAL RAINS AND DUSTINGS OF SNOW
4362-15663-0056 MOST OF WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY FAR TOO JOYOUS AND LIFE GIVING TO BE REGARDED AS STORMS SINGLE CLOUDS GROWING IN THE SUNNY SKY RIPENING IN AN HOUR SHOWERING THE HEATED LANDSCAPE AND PASSING AWAY LIKE A THOUGHT
4362-15663-0057 ASSUMING A VIOLENCE AND ENERGY OF EXPRESSION SCARCELY SURPASSED BY THOSE BRED IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER SUCH WAS THE STORM NOW GATHERING ABOUT US IT BEGAN TO DECLARE ITSELF SHORTLY AFTER NOON
4362-15663-0058 SUGGESTING TO US THE IDEA OF AT ONCE SEEKING OUR SAFE CAMP IN THE TIMBER AND ABANDONING THE PURPOSE OF MAKING AN OBSERVATION OF THE BAROMETER AT THREE P M TWO HAVING ALREADY BEEN MADE
4362-15663-0059 WHILE SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AT STRAWBERRY VALLEY JEROME PEERED AT SHORT INTERVALS OVER THE RIDGE CONTEMPLATING THE RISING CLOUDS WITH ANXIOUS GESTURES IN THE ROUGH WIND AND AT LENGTH DECLARED THAT IF WE DID NOT MAKE A SPEEDY ESCAPE
4362-15663-0060 WE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PASS THE REST OF THE DAY AND NIGHT ON THE SUMMIT BUT ANXIETY TO COMPLETE MY OBSERVATIONS STIFLED MY OWN INSTINCTIVE PROMPTINGS TO RETREAT AND HELD ME TO MY WORK NO INEXPERIENCED PERSON WAS DEPENDING ON ME
4362-15663-0061 AND I TOLD JEROME THAT WE TWO MOUNTAINEERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR WAY DOWN THROUGH ANY STORM LIKELY TO FALL PRESENTLY THIN FIBROUS FILMS OF CLOUD BEGAN TO BLOW DIRECTLY OVER THE SUMMIT FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
4362-15663-0062 DRAWN OUT IN LONG FAIRY WEBS LIKE CARDED WOOL FORMING AND DISSOLVING AS IF BY MAGIC THE WIND TWISTED THEM INTO RINGLETS AND WHIRLED THEM IN A SUCCESSION OF GRACEFUL CONVOLUTIONS LIKE THE OUTSIDE SPRAYS OF YOSEMITE FALLS IN FLOOD TIME
4362-15663-0063 THEN SAILING OUT INTO THE THIN AZURE OVER THE PRECIPITOUS BRINK OF THE RIDGE THEY WERE DRIFTED TOGETHER LIKE WREATHS OF FOAM ON A RIVER THESE HIGHER AND FINER CLOUD FABRICS
4362-15663-0064 ILL DEFINED EMBANKMENT FROM THE ICY MESHES OF WHICH SNOW FLOWERS BEGAN TO FALL ALTERNATING WITH HAIL THE SKY SPEEDILY DARKENED AND JUST AS I HAD COMPLETED MY LAST OBSERVATION AND BOXED MY INSTRUMENTS READY FOR THE DESCENT
