2836-5355-0047 AND CALLING THE SERVANTS BEFORE HIM THERE WERE BUT TWO GAVE THEM EACH A YEAR'S WAGES IN ADVANCE
2836-5355-0048 THEN HE PAID A VISIT TO THE LANDLORD AND HANDED HIM LIKEWISE A YEAR'S RENT IN ADVANCE MAKING THE SAME REMARK AFTER THAT HE ORDERED DINNER AT A HOTEL AND THE SAME NIGHT HE AND PIERRE DEPARTED ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME AGAIN
2836-5355-0049 SIR FRANCIS THANKING HIS LUCKY STAR THAT HE HAD SO EASILY GOT RID OF A VEXATIOUS ANNOYANCE AND LADY ISABEL SHE PASSED HER EVENING ALONE SITTING IN THE SAME PLACE CLOSE TO THE FIRE AND THE SPARKS
2836-5355-0050 INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHEN LADY ISABEL LAY DOWN TO REST SHE SANK INTO A SOMEWHAT CALMER SLEEP THAN SHE HAD KNOWN OF LATE ALSO INTO A DREAM SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BACK AT EAST LYNNE NOT BACK IN ONE SENSE
2836-5355-0051 BUT THAT SHE SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE GONE AWAY FROM IT WALKING IN THE FLOWER GARDEN WITH MISTER CARLYLE WHILE THE THREE CHILDREN PLAYED ON THE LAWN HER ARM WAS WITHIN HER HUSBAND'S AND HE WAS RELATING SOMETHING TO HER WHAT THE NEWS WAS SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER AFTERWARD
2836-5355-0052 EXCEPTING THAT IT WAS CONNECTED WITH THE OFFICE AND OLD MISTER DILL AND THAT MISTER CARLYLE LAUGHED WHEN HE TOLD IT THEY APPEARED TO BE INTERRUPTED BY THE CRYING OF ARCHIBALD AND IN TURNING TO THE LAWN TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER SHE AWOKE
2836-5355-0053 ALAS IT WAS THE ACTUAL CRYING OF HER OWN CHILD WHICH AWOKE HER THIS LAST CHILD THE ILL FATED LITTLE BEING IN THE CRADLE BESIDE HER
2843-152918-0000 THEY HAD UNDERGONE A REMARKABLE CHANGE SINCE OUR ARRIVAL AT THE BUTCHER'S SHOP THEY NOW WANDERED ABOUT FAT SLEEK AND CONTENTED AND THEIR FORMER VORACITY HAD COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED
2843-152918-0001 AS REGARDS OURSELVES A DAY OR TWO LONGER MADE NO DIFFERENCE OUR MOST IMPORTANT ARTICLE OF DIET THE PEMMICAN WAS PRACTICALLY LEFT UNTOUCHED AS FOR THE TIME BEING DOG HAD COMPLETELY TAKEN ITS PLACE
2843-152918-0002 THERE WAS THUS NO GREAT SIGN OF DEPRESSION TO BE NOTICED WHEN WE CAME BACK INTO THE TENT AFTER FINISHING OUR WORK AND HAD TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME AS I WENT IN I COULD DESCRY WISTING A LITTLE WAY OFF KNEELING ON THE GROUND
2843-152918-0003 AND ENGAGED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CUTLETS THE DOGS STOOD IN A RING ROUND HIM AND LOOKED ON WITH INTEREST THE NORTH EAST WIND WHISTLED AND HOWLED THE AIR WAS THICK WITH DRIVING SNOW AND WISTING WAS NOT TO BE ENVIED
2843-152918-0004 TO WHATEVER AGE I MAY LIVE IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT THE WIND HAD GONE BACK TO THE NORTH AND INCREASED TO A GALE IT WAS BLOWING AND SNOWING SO THAT WHEN WE CAME OUT IN THE MORNING WE COULD NOT SEE THE SLEDGES THEY WERE HALF SNOWED UNDER
2843-152918-0005 THE TEMPERATURE WAS NOT SO VERY LOW
2843-152918-0006 WE HAD ALL TAKEN A TURN OUTSIDE TO LOOK AT THE WEATHER AND WERE SITTING ON OUR SLEEPING BAGS DISCUSSING THE POOR PROSPECT IT'S THE DEVIL'S OWN WEATHER HERE AT THE BUTCHER'S SAID ONE IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT WOULD NEVER GET ANY BETTER
2843-152918-0007 THIS IS THE FIFTH DAY AND IT'S BLOWING WORSE THAN EVER WE ALL AGREED THERE'S NOTHING SO BAD AS LYING WEATHER BOUND LIKE THIS CONTINUED ANOTHER IT TAKES MORE OUT OF YOU THAN GOING FROM MORNING TO NIGHT PERSONALLY I WAS OF THE SAME OPINION
2843-152918-0008 ONE DAY MAY BE PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT TWO THREE FOUR
2843-152918-0009 NO IT WAS AWFUL SHALL WE TRY IT NO SOONER WAS THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED THAN IT WAS ACCEPTED UNANIMOUSLY AND WITH ACCLAMATION WHEN I THINK OF MY FOUR FRIENDS OF THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
2843-152918-0010 IT IS THE MEMORY OF THAT MORNING THAT COMES FIRST TO MY MIND ALL THE QUALITIES THAT I MOST ADMIRE IN A MAN WERE CLEARLY SHOWN AT THAT JUNCTURE COURAGE AND DAUNTLESSNESS WITHOUT BOASTING OR BIG WORDS
2843-152918-0011 AMID JOKING AND CHAFF EVERYTHING WAS PACKED AND THEN OUT INTO THE BLIZZARD IT WAS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP ONE'S EYES OPEN THE FINE DRIFT SNOW PENETRATED EVERYWHERE
2843-152918-0012 THE DOGS WERE NOT MUCH INCLINED TO START AND IT TOOK TIME TO GET THEM INTO THEIR HARNESS BUT AT LAST WE WERE READY ONE MORE GLANCE OVER THE CAMPING GROUND TO SEE THAT NOTHING WE OUGHT TO HAVE WITH US HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN
2843-152918-0013 WHICH WE NOW THOUGHT WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED WERE LEFT BEHIND THE LAST THING TO BE DONE WAS PLANTING A BROKEN SKI UPRIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE DEPOT IT WAS WISTING WHO DID THIS THINKING PRESUMABLY THAT AN EXTRA MARK WOULD DO NO HARM
2843-152918-0014 THAT IT WAS A HAPPY THOUGHT THE FUTURE WILL SHOW AND THEN WE WERE OFF IT WAS A HARD PULL TO BEGIN WITH BOTH FOR MEN AND BEASTS AS THE HIGH SASTRUGI CONTINUED TOWARDS THE SOUTH
2843-152918-0015 AND MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ADVANCE THOSE WHO HAD SLEDGES TO DRIVE HAD TO BE VERY ATTENTIVE AND SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY DID NOT CAPSIZE ON THE BIG WAVES AND WE WHO HAD NO SLEDGES FOUND GREAT DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING OUR FEET
2843-152918-0016 AS WE HAD NOTHING TO LEAN AGAINST WE WENT ON LIKE THIS SLOWLY ENOUGH BUT THE MAIN THING WAS THAT WE MADE PROGRESS THE GROUND AT FIRST GAVE ONE THE IMPRESSION OF RISING THOUGH NOT MUCH THE GOING WAS EXTREMELY HEAVY
2843-152918-0017 IT WAS LIKE DRAGGING ONESELF THROUGH SAND MEANWHILE THE SASTRUGI GREW SMALLER AND SMALLER AND FINALLY THEY DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER AND THE SURFACE BECAME QUITE FLAT THE GOING ALSO IMPROVED BY DEGREES
2843-152918-0018 FOR WHAT REASON IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY AS THE STORM CONTINUED UNABATED AND THE DRIFT NOW COMBINED WITH FALLING SNOW WAS THICKER THAN EVER IT WAS ALL THE DRIVER COULD DO TO SEE HIS OWN DOGS THE SURFACE
2843-152918-0019 WHICH HAD BECOME PERFECTLY LEVEL HAD THE APPEARANCE AT TIMES OF SINKING IN ANY CASE ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO FROM THE PACE OF THE SLEDGES NOW AND AGAIN THE DOGS WOULD SET OFF SUDDENLY AT A GALLOP THE WIND AFT NO DOUBT HELPED THE PACE SOMEWHAT
2843-152918-0020 BUT IT ALONE COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE I DID NOT LIKE THIS TENDENCY OF THE GROUND TO FALL AWAY IN MY OPINION WE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE WITH ANYTHING OF THAT SORT AFTER REACHING THE HEIGHT AT WHICH WE WERE A SLIGHT SLOPE UPWARD
2843-152918-0021 POSSIBLY BUT DOWN NO THAT DID NOT AGREE WITH MY RECKONING SO FAR THE INCLINE HAD NOT BEEN SO GREAT AS TO CAUSE UNEASINESS BUT IF IT SERIOUSLY BEGAN TO GO DOWNHILL WE SHOULD HAVE TO STOP AND CAMP
2843-152918-0022 WOULD BE MADNESS WE MIGHT RISK FALLING INTO SOME CHASM BEFORE WE HAD TIME TO PULL UP HANSSEN AS USUAL WAS DRIVING FIRST STRICTLY SPEAKING I SHOULD NOW HAVE BEEN GOING IN ADVANCE BUT THE UNEVEN SURFACE AT THE START
2843-152918-0023 AND THE RAPID PACE AFTERWARDS HAD MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WALK AS FAST THE DOGS COULD PULL I WAS THEREFORE FOLLOWING BY THE SIDE OF WISTING'S SLEDGE AND CHATTING WITH HIM SUDDENLY I SAW HANSSEN'S DOGS SHOOT AHEAD
2843-152918-0024 AND DOWNHILL THEY WENT AT THE WILDEST PACE WISTING AFTER THEM I SHOUTED TO HANSSEN TO STOP
2843-152918-0025 BY TWISTING HIS SLEDGE THE OTHERS WHO WERE FOLLOWING STOPPED WHEN THEY CAME UP TO HIM WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAIRLY STEEP DESCENT WHAT THERE MIGHT BE BELOW WAS NOT EASY TO DECIDE NOR WOULD WE TRY TO FIND OUT IN THAT WEATHER
2843-152918-0026 WE TRAMPLED DOWN A PLACE FOR THE TENT IN THE LOOSE SNOW AND SOON GOT IT UP IT WAS NOT A LONG DAY'S MARCH THAT WE HAD DONE ELEVEN AND THREE QUARTER MILES BUT WE HAD PUT AN END TO OUR STAY AT THE BUTCHER'S SHOP AND THAT WAS A GREAT THING
2843-152918-0027 THE BOILING POINT TEST THAT EVENING SHOWED THAT WE WERE TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND THAT WE HAD THUS GONE DOWN SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FEET FROM THE BUTCHER'S WE TURNED IN AND WENT TO SLEEP AS SOON AS IT BRIGHTENED
2843-152918-0028 ONE HAS TO SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN THESE REGIONS IF ONE NEGLECTS TO DO SO IT MAY MEAN A LONG WAIT AND MUCH MAY BE LOST WE THEREFORE ALL SLEPT WITH ONE EYE OPEN
2843-152918-0029 AND WE KNEW WELL THAT NOTHING COULD HAPPEN WITHOUT OUR NOTICING IT AT THREE IN THE MORNING THE SUN CUT THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND WE THROUGH THE TENT DOOR TO TAKE IN THE SITUATION WAS MORE THAN THE WORK OF A MOMENT
2843-152918-0030 THE SUN SHOWED AS YET LIKE A PAT OF BUTTER AND HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN DISPERSING THE THICK MISTS THE WIND HAD DROPPED SOMEWHAT BUT WAS STILL FAIRLY STRONG THIS IS AFTER ALL THE WORST PART OF ONE'S JOB
2843-152918-0031 TURNING OUT OF ONE'S GOOD WARM SLEEPING BAG AND STANDING OUTSIDE FOR SOME TIME IN THIN CLOTHES WATCHING THE WEATHER WE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT A GLEAM LIKE THIS A CLEARING IN THE WEATHER MIGHT COME SUDDENLY AND THEN ONE HAD TO BE ON THE SPOT
2843-152918-0032 THE GLEAM CAME IT DID NOT LAST LONG BUT LONG ENOUGH WE LAY ON THE SIDE OF A RIDGE THAT FELL AWAY PRETTY STEEPLY THE DESCENT ON THE SOUTH WAS TOO ABRUPT BUT ON THE SOUTH EAST IT WAS BETTER AND MORE GRADUAL
2843-152918-0033 AND ENDED IN A WIDE LEVEL TRACT WE COULD SEE NO CREVASSES OR UNPLEASANTNESS OF ANY KIND IT WAS NOT VERY FAR THAT WE COULD SEE THOUGH ONLY OUR NEAREST SURROUNDINGS OF THE MOUNTAINS WE SAW NOTHING
2843-152918-0034 HAD NOW BROKEN LOOSE AGAIN AND THE NORTH EASTER WAS DOING ALL IT COULD
2843-152918-0035 SINCE WE HAD DISCOVERED THE NATURE OF OUR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS IF WE ONCE GOT DOWN TO THE PLAIN WE KNEW THAT WE COULD ALWAYS FEEL OUR WAY ON AFTER PUTTING AMPLE BRAKES ON THE SLEDGE RUNNERS
2843-152918-0036 WE STARTED OFF DOWNHILL IN A SOUTH EASTERLY DIRECTION THE SLIGHT IDEA OF THE POSITION THAT WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET IN THE MORNING PROVED CORRECT THE DESCENT WAS EASY AND SMOOTH AND WE REACHED THE PLAIN WITHOUT ANY ADVENTURE
2843-152918-0037 WE COULD NOW ONCE MORE SET OUR FACES TO THE SOUTH AND IN THICK DRIVING SNOW WE CONTINUED OUR WAY INTO THE UNKNOWN WITH GOOD ASSISTANCE FROM THE HOWLING NORTH EASTERLY GALE WE NOW RECOMMENCED THE ERECTION OF BEACONS
2843-152918-0038 WHICH HAD NOT BEEN NECESSARY DURING THE ASCENT
2843-152918-0039 THE LAST OF THEM THAT WE ENCOUNTERED THE SURFACE WAS NOW FINE ENOUGH SMOOTH AS A FLOOR AND WITHOUT A SIGN OF SASTRUGI IF OUR PROGRESS WAS NEVERTHELESS SLOW AND DIFFICULT THIS WAS DUE TO THE WRETCHED GOING
2843-152918-0040 WHICH WAS REAL TORTURE TO ALL OF US A SLEDGE JOURNEY THROUGH THE SAHARA COULD NOT HAVE OFFERED A WORSE SURFACE TO MOVE OVER
2843-152918-0041 THE WEATHER IMPROVED IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND WHEN WE CAMPED IN THE AFTERNOON IT LOOKED QUITE SMILING THE SUN CAME THROUGH AND GAVE A DELIGHTFUL WARMTH AFTER THE LAST FEW BITTER DAYS IT WAS NOT YET CLEAR
2843-152918-0042 SO THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING OF OUR SURROUNDINGS THE DISTANCE ACCORDING TO OUR THREE SLEDGE METERS WAS EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILES TAKING THE BAD GOING INTO CONSIDERATION WE HAD REASON TO BE WELL SATISFIED WITH IT
2843-152918-0043 OUR ALTITUDE CAME OUT AT NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE SEA OR A DROP OF EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FEET IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY THIS SURPRISED ME GREATLY WHAT DID IT MEAN
2843-152918-0044 INSTEAD OF RISING GRADUALLY WE WERE GOING SLOWLY DOWN
2843-152918-0045 BUT WHAT ACCORDING TO DEAD RECKONING OUR LATITUDE THAT EVENING
2843-152918-0046 THE NIGHT WAS FILLED WITH SHARP GUSTS FROM THE NORTH THE MORNING CAME WITH A SLACK WIND BUT ACCOMPANIED BY MIST AND SNOWFALL THIS WAS ABOMINABLE HERE WE WERE ADVANCING OVER ABSOLUTELY VIRGIN GROUND AND ABLE TO SEE NOTHING
2843-152918-0047 THE SURFACE REMAINED ABOUT THE SAME POSSIBLY RATHER MORE UNDULATING THAT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING HERE AT SOME TIME AND VIOLENTLY TOO WAS SHOWN BY THE UNDER SURFACE WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF SASTRUGI AS HARD AS IRON
2843-152918-0048 LUCKILY FOR US THE SNOWFALL OF THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD FILLED THESE UP SO AS TO PRESENT A LEVEL SURFACE IT WAS HEAVY GOING THOUGH BETTER THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AS WE WERE ADVANCING STILL BLINDLY
2843-152918-0049 AND FRETTING AT THE PERSISTENTLY THICK WEATHER ONE OF US SUDDENLY CALLED OUT HULLO LOOK THERE A WILD DARK SUMMIT ROSE HIGH OUT OF THE MASS OF FOG TO THE EAST SOUTH EAST IT WAS NOT FAR AWAY
2843-152918-0050 ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED THREATENINGLY NEAR AND RIGHT OVER US WE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT THE IMPOSING SIGHT BUT NATURE DID NOT EXPOSE HER OBJECTS OF INTEREST FOR LONG THE FOG ROLLED OVER AGAIN THICK HEAVY AND DARK
2843-152918-0051 AND BLOTTED OUT THE VIEW WE KNEW NOW THAT WE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR SURPRISES AFTER WE HAD GONE ABOUT TEN MILES THE FOG AGAIN LIFTED FOR A MOMENT AND WE SAW QUITE NEAR A MILE OR SO AWAY
2843-152918-0052 TWO LONG NARROW MOUNTAIN RIDGES TO THE WEST OF US RUNNING NORTH AND SOUTH AND COMPLETELY COVERED WITH SNOW THESE
2843-152918-0053 THEY WERE BETWEEN NINE THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH AND WOULD PROBABLY SERVE AS EXCELLENT LANDMARKS ON THE RETURN JOURNEY THERE WAS NO CONNECTION TO BE TRACED BETWEEN THESE MOUNTAINS AND THOSE LYING TO THE EAST OF THEM
2843-152918-0054 THEY GAVE US THE IMPRESSION OF BEING ENTIRELY ISOLATED SUMMITS AS WE COULD NOT MAKE OUT ANY LOFTY RIDGE RUNNING EAST AND WEST
2843-152918-0055 WE CONTINUED OUR COURSE IN THE CONSTANT EXPECTATION OF FINDING SOME SURPRISE OR OTHER IN OUR LINE OF ROUTE THE AIR AHEAD OF US WAS AS BLACK AS PITCH AS THOUGH IT CONCEALED SOMETHING
2843-152918-0056 IT COULD NOT BE A STORM OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALREADY UPON US BUT WE WENT ON AND ON AND NOTHING CAME OUR DAY'S MARCH WAS EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILES I SEE THAT MY DIARY FOR NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH
2843-152918-0057 DOES NOT BEGIN VERY PROMISINGLY FOG FOG AND AGAIN FOG ALSO FINE FALLING SNOW WHICH MAKES THE GOING IMPOSSIBLE POOR BEASTS THEY HAVE TOILED HARD TO GET THE SLEDGES FORWARD TO DAY
2843-152918-0058 BUT THE DAY DID NOT TURN OUT SO BADLY AFTER ALL AS WE WORKED OUR WAY OUT OF THIS UNCERTAINTY AND FOUND OUT WHAT WAS BEHIND THE PITCH DARK CLOUDS DURING THE FORENOON THE SUN CAME THROUGH AND THRUST ASIDE THE FOG FOR A WHILE AND THERE
2843-152918-0059 TO THE SOUTH EAST NOT MANY MILES AWAY LAY AN IMMENSE MOUNTAIN MASS FROM THIS MASS RIGHT ACROSS OUR COURSE RAN A GREAT ANCIENT GLACIER THE SUN SHONE DOWN UPON IT AND SHOWED US A SURFACE FULL OF HUGE IRREGULARITIES
2843-152918-0060 ON THE SIDE NEAREST TO THE MOUNTAIN THESE DISTURBANCES WERE SUCH THAT A HASTY GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SHOW US THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ADVANCING THAT WAY BUT RIGHT IN OUR LINE OF ROUTE STRAIGHT ON TO THE GLACIER
2843-152918-0061 AND WAITED FOR DECENTLY CLEAR WEATHER SO THAT WE MIGHT SURVEY THE GROUND AT OUR EASE AND CHOOSE THE BEST WAY GOING FORWARD WITHOUT AN IDEA OF WHAT THE GROUND WAS LIKE WAS NOT VERY PLEASANT
2843-152918-0062 BUT HOW LONG SHOULD WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR CLEAR WEATHER THAT QUESTION WAS UNANSWERABLE POSSIBLY A WEEK OR EVEN A FORTNIGHT AND WE HAD NO TIME FOR THAT BETTER GO STRAIGHT ON THEN AND TAKE WHAT MIGHT COME
2843-152918-0063 WHAT WE COULD SEE OF THE GLACIER APPEARED TO BE PRETTY STEEP BUT IT WAS ONLY BETWEEN THE SOUTH AND SOUTH EAST UNDER THE NEW LAND THAT THE FOG NOW AND AGAIN LIFTED SUFFICIENTLY TO ENABLE US TO SEE ANYTHING
2843-152918-0064 WE COULD SEE THAT THE BIG CREVASSES LOST THEMSELVES IN IT AND THE QUESTION OF WHAT THE GLACIER LOOKED LIKE ON THE WEST
2843-152918-0065 IT WAS PLAIN ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD HAVE STIFF WORK IT WAS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE ON THE SLEDGES WE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO BUILD THE DEPOT THE SNOW HERE WAS EXCELLENT FOR THIS PURPOSE
2843-152918-0066 AS HARD AS GLASS IN A SHORT TIME AN IMMENSE ERECTION OF ADAMANTINE BLOCKS OF SNOW ROSE INTO THE AIR CONTAINING PROVISIONS FOR FIVE MEN FOR SIX DAYS AND FOR EIGHTEEN DOGS FOR FIVE DAYS
2843-152918-0067 A NUMBER OF SMALL ARTICLES WERE ALSO LEFT BEHIND WHILE WE WERE THUS OCCUPIED THE FOG HAD BEEN COMING AND GOING SOME OF THE INTERVALS HAD BEEN QUITE CLEAR AND HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD VIEW OF THE NEAREST PART OF THE RANGE
2843-152918-0068 IT APPEARED TO BE QUITE ISOLATED AND TO CONSIST OF FOUR MOUNTAINS ONE OF THESE MOUNT HELMER HANSSEN LAY SEPARATED FROM THE REST THE OTHER THREE MOUNTS OSCAR WISTING
2843-152918-0069 AND OLAV BJAALAND LAY CLOSER TOGETHER BEHIND THIS GROUP THE AIR HAD BEEN HEAVY AND BLACK THE WHOLE TIME SHOWING THAT MORE LAND MUST BE CONCEALED THERE SUDDENLY
2843-152918-0070 AND THE SUMMITS OF A COLOSSAL MOUNTAIN MASS APPEARED OUR FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THIS MOUNTAIN MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN MUST BE SOMETHING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND FEET HIGH IT POSITIVELY TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY
2843-152918-0071 SO FORMIDABLE DID IT APPEAR BUT IT WAS ONLY A GLIMPSE THAT WE HAD AND THEN THE FOG ENCLOSED IT ONCE MORE WE HAD SUCCEEDED IN TAKING A FEW MEAGRE BEARINGS OF THE DIFFERENT SUMMITS OF THE NEAREST GROUP
2843-152918-0072 THEY WERE NOT VERY GRAND BUT BETTER ONES WERE NOT TO BE OBTAINED FOR THAT MATTER THE SITE OF THE DEPOT WAS SO WELL MARKED BY ITS POSITION UNDER THE FOOT OF THE GLACIER THAT WE AGREED IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS IT
2843-152918-0073 HAVING FINISHED THE EDIFICE WHICH ROSE AT LEAST SIX FEET INTO THE AIR
2843-152918-0074 SO AS TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT STILL MORE EASILY ON THE WAY BACK AN OBSERVATION WE HAD CONTRIVED TO TAKE WHILE THE WORK WAS IN PROGRESS
2843-152918-0075 THIS DID NOT AGREE VERY WELL WITH THE LATITUDE OF OUR DEAD RECKONING
2843-152918-0076 AND A FINE LIGHT SNOW WAS FALLING WE HAD TAKEN A BEARING OF THE LINE OF GLACIER THAT WAS MOST FREE OF CREVASSES AND SO WE MOVED ON AGAIN
2843-152918-0077 THE CREVASSES AT ITS FOOT WERE NOT LARGE BUT WE HAD NO SOONER ENTERED UPON THE ASCENT THAN THE FUN BEGAN THERE WAS SOMETHING UNCANNY ABOUT THIS PERFECTLY BLIND ADVANCE AMONG CREVASSES AND CHASMS ON ALL SIDES
