3607-135982-0051 THE CABIN DOOR OPENED AND HE SAW THE HUNGARIAN STANDING IN A SHAFT OF GREY LIGHT
3607-29116-0000 LAURA WENT DOWN STAIRS KNOCKED AT THE STUDY DOOR AND ENTERED SCARCELY WAITING FOR THE RESPONSE SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS ALONE WITH AN OPEN BIBLE IN HIS HAND UPSIDE DOWN LAURA SMILED AND SAID FORGETTING HER ACQUIRED CORRECTNESS OF SPEECH IT IS ONLY ME

3607-29116-0013 RUNNING HIS EYE DOWN THE LIST THAT'S ENCOURAGING WHAT IS THE C BEFORE SOME OF THE NAMES AND THE B B THOSE ARE MY PRIVATE MARKS THAT C STANDS FOR CONVINCED WITH ARGUMENT
3607-29116-0014 I EXPECT TO SEE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE TO DAY MISTER BUCKSTONE
3607-29116-0015 BUT HE HAS CHARITABLE IMPULSES IF WE SECURE HIM WE SHALL HAVE A FAVORABLE REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE
3607-29116-0016 OH I SAW SENATOR BALLOON HE WILL HELP US I SUPPOSE BALLOON IS A WHOLE HEARTED FELLOW I CAN'T HELP LOVING THAT MAN FOR ALL HIS DROLLERY AND WAGGISHNESS HE PUTS ON AN AIR OF LEVITY SOMETIMES BUT THERE AINT A MAN IN THE SENATE KNOWS THE SCRIPTURES AS HE DOES
3607-29116-0017 HE DID NOT MAKE ANY OBJECTIONS NOT EXACTLY HE SAID SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID ASKED LAURA GLANCING FURTIVELY AT HIM CERTAINLY HE SAID HE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS A GOOD THING IF SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS IN IT IT WOULD PAY TO LOOK INTO IT
3607-29116-0018 THE SENATOR LAUGHED BUT RATHER FEEBLY AND SAID BALLOON IS ALWAYS FULL OF HIS JOKES I EXPLAINED IT TO HIM HE SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT HE ONLY WANTED A WORD WITH YOU CONTINUED LAURA HE IS A HANDSOME OLD GENTLEMAN AND HE IS GALLANT FOR AN OLD MAN
3607-29116-0019 MY DAUGHTER SAID THE SENATOR WITH A GRAVE LOOK I TRUST THERE WAS NOTHING FREE IN HIS MANNER FREE REPEATED LAURA WITH INDIGNATION IN HER FACE WITH ME THERE THERE CHILD I MEANT NOTHING BALLOON TALKS A LITTLE FREELY SOMETIMES WITH MEN
3607-29116-0020 BUT HE IS RIGHT AT HEART HIS TERM EXPIRES NEXT YEAR AND I FEAR WE SHALL LOSE HIM HE SEEMED TO BE PACKING THE DAY I WAS THERE HIS ROOMS WERE FULL OF DRY GOODS BOXES INTO WHICH HIS SERVANT WAS CROWDING ALL MANNER OF OLD CLOTHES AND STUFF
3607-29116-0021 I SUPPOSE HE WILL PAINT PUB DOCS ON THEM AND FRANK THEM HOME THAT'S GOOD ECONOMY ISN'T IT YES YES BUT CHILD ALL CONGRESSMEN DO THAT IT MAY NOT BE STRICTLY HONEST INDEED IT IS NOT UNLESS HE HAD SOME PUBLIC DOCUMENTS MIXED IN WITH THE CLOTHES
3607-29116-0022 IT'S A FUNNY WORLD GOOD BYE UNCLE I'M GOING TO SEE THAT CHAIRMAN AND HUMMING A CHEERY OPERA AIR SHE DEPARTED TO HER ROOM TO DRESS FOR GOING OUT BEFORE SHE DID THAT HOWEVER SHE TOOK OUT HER NOTE BOOK AND WAS SOON DEEP IN ITS CONTENTS MARKING DASHING
3607-29116-0023 ERASING FIGURING AND TALKING TO HERSELF FREE I WONDER WHAT DILWORTHY DOES THINK OF ME ANYWAY ONE TWO EIGHT SEVENTEEN
3607-29116-0024 WOULDN'T DILWORTHY OPEN HIS EYES IF HE KNEW SOME OF THE THINGS BALLOON DID SAY TO ME THERE HOPPERSON'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO COUNT TWENTY THE SANCTIMONIOUS OLD CURMUDGEON SON IN LAW SINECURE IN THE NEGRO INSTITUTION THAT ABOUT GAUGES HIM THE THREE COMMITTEEMEN
3607-29116-0025 SONS IN LAW NOTHING LIKE A SON IN LAW HERE IN WASHINGTON OR A BROTHER IN LAW AND EVERYBODY HAS EM LET'S SEE SIXTY ONE WITH PLACES TWENTY FIVE PERSUADED IT IS GETTING ON WE'LL HAVE TWO THIRDS OF CONGRESS IN TIME DILWORTHY MUST SURELY KNOW I UNDERSTAND HIM
3607-29116-0026 UNCLE DILWORTHY UNCLE BALLOON TELLS VERY AMUSING STORIES WHEN LADIES ARE NOT PRESENT I SHOULD THINK SO M M EIGHTY FIVE THERE I MUST FIND THAT CHAIRMAN QUEER BUCKSTONE ACTS
3607-29116-0027 SEEMED TO BE IN LOVE I WAS SURE OF IT HE PROMISED TO COME HERE AND HE HASN'T STRANGE VERY STRANGE I MUST CHANCE TO MEET HIM TO DAY LAURA DRESSED AND WENT OUT THINKING SHE WAS PERHAPS TOO EARLY FOR MISTER BUCKSTONE TO COME FROM THE HOUSE
3607-29116-0028 BUT AS HE LODGED NEAR THE BOOKSTORE SHE WOULD DROP IN THERE AND KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR HIM WHILE LAURA IS ON HER ERRAND TO FIND MISTER BUCKSTONE IT MAY NOT BE OUT OF THE WAY TO REMARK THAT SHE KNEW QUITE AS MUCH OF WASHINGTON LIFE AS SENATOR DILWORTHY GAVE HER CREDIT FOR
3607-29116-0029 AND MORE THAN SHE THOUGHT PROPER TO TELL HIM SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY THIS TIME WITH A GOOD MANY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS OF NEWSPAPER ROW AND EXCHANGED GOSSIP WITH THEM TO THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE
3607-29116-0030 THEY WERE ALWAYS TALKING IN THE ROW EVERLASTINGLY GOSSIPING BANTERING AND SARCASTICALLY PRAISING THINGS AND GOING ON IN A STYLE WHICH WAS A CURIOUS COMMINGLING OF EARNEST AND PERSIFLAGE COLONEL SELLERS LIKED THIS TALK AMAZINGLY THOUGH HE WAS SOMETIMES A LITTLE AT SEA IN IT
3607-29116-0031 AND PERHAPS THAT DIDN'T LESSEN THE RELISH OF THE CONVERSATION TO THE CORRESPONDENTS IT SEEMS THAT THEY HAD GOT HOLD OF THE DRY GOODS BOX PACKING STORY ABOUT BALLOON ONE DAY AND WERE TALKING IT OVER WHEN THE COLONEL CAME IN THE COLONEL WANTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT AND HICKS TOLD HIM
3607-29116-0032 AND THEN HICKS WENT ON WITH A SERIOUS AIR COLONEL IF YOU REGISTER A LETTER IT MEANS THAT IT IS OF VALUE DOESN'T IT AND IF YOU PAY FIFTEEN CENTS FOR REGISTERING IT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE EXTRA CARE OF IT AND EVEN PAY YOU BACK ITS FULL VALUE IF IT IS LOST ISN'T THAT SO
3607-29116-0033 YES I SUPPOSE IT'S SO WELL SENATOR BALLOON PUT FIFTEEN CENTS WORTH OF STAMPS ON EACH OF THOSE SEVEN HUGE BOXES OF OLD CLOTHES AND SHIPPED THAT TON OF SECOND HAND RUBBISH OLD BOOTS AND PANTALOONS AND WHAT NOT THROUGH THE MAILS AS REGISTERED MATTER
3607-29116-0034 IT WAS AN INGENIOUS THING AND IT HAD A GENUINE TOUCH OF HUMOR ABOUT IT TOO I THINK THERE IS MORE REAL TALENT AMONG OUR PUBLIC MEN OF TO DAY THAN THERE WAS AMONG THOSE OF OLD TIMES A FAR MORE FERTILE FANCY A MUCH HAPPIER INGENUITY
3607-29116-0035 NOW COLONEL CAN YOU PICTURE JEFFERSON OR WASHINGTON OR JOHN ADAMS FRANKING THEIR WARDROBES THROUGH THE MAILS AND ADDING THE FACETIOUS IDEA OF MAKING THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARGO FOR THE SUM OF ONE DOLLAR AND FIVE CENTS STATESMEN WERE DULL CREATURES IN THOSE DAYS
3607-29116-0036 I HAVE A MUCH GREATER ADMIRATION FOR SENATOR BALLOON YES BALLOON IS A MAN OF PARTS THERE IS NO DENYING IT I THINK SO HE IS SPOKEN OF FOR THE POST OF MINISTER TO CHINA OR AUSTRIA AND I HOPE WILL BE APPOINTED
3607-29116-0037 WHAT WE WANT ABROAD IS GOOD EXAMPLES OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER JOHN JAY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WERE WELL ENOUGH IN THEIR DAY BUT THE NATION HAS MADE PROGRESS SINCE THEN BALLOON IS A MAN WE KNOW AND CAN DEPEND ON TO BE TRUE TO HIMSELF
3607-29116-0038 YES AND BALLOON HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL OF PUBLIC EXPERIENCE HE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE HE WAS GOVERNOR OF ONE OF THE TERRITORIES A WHILE AND WAS VERY SATISFACTORY INDEED HE WAS HE WAS EX OFFICIO INDIAN AGENT TOO
3607-29116-0039 WHOSE LAND HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM BY THE WHITE MAN IN THE INTERESTS OF CIVILIZATION BUT BALLOON KNEW THEIR NEEDS BETTER HE BUILT A GOVERNMENT SAW MILL ON THE RESERVATION WITH THE MONEY AND THE LUMBER SOLD FOR ENORMOUS PRICES A RELATIVE OF HIS DID ALL THE WORK FREE OF CHARGE
3607-29116-0040 THAT IS TO SAY HE CHARGED NOTHING MORE THAN THE LUMBER WOULD BRING BUT THE POOR INJUNS NOT THAT I CARE MUCH FOR INJUNS WHAT DID HE DO FOR THEM GAVE THEM THE OUTSIDE SLABS TO FENCE IN THE RESERVATION WITH GOVERNOR BALLOON WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A FATHER TO THE POOR INDIANS BUT BALLOON IS NOT ALONE
3607-29116-0041 WE HAVE MANY TRULY NOBLE STATESMEN IN OUR COUNTRY'S SERVICE LIKE BALLOON THE SENATE IS FULL OF THEM DON'T YOU THINK SO COLONEL WELL I DUNNO I HONOR MY COUNTRY'S PUBLIC SERVANTS AS MUCH AS ANY ONE CAN I MEET THEM SIR EVERY DAY AND THE MORE I SEE OF THEM
3607-29116-0042 OF SECURING THEIR SERVICES FEW LANDS ARE SO BLEST THAT IS TRUE COLONEL TO BE SURE YOU CAN BUY NOW AND THEN A SENATOR OR A REPRESENTATIVE BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW IT IS WRONG AND SO THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED OF IT THEY ARE GENTLE AND CONFIDING AND CHILDLIKE
3607-29116-0043 AND IN MY OPINION THESE ARE QUALITIES THAT ENNOBLE THEM FAR MORE THAN ANY AMOUNT OF
3607-29116-0044 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU COLONEL SELLERS WELL HESITATED THE COLONEL I AM AFRAID SOME OF THEM DO BUY THEIR SEATS YES I AM AFRAID THEY DO BUT AS SENATOR DILWORTHY HIMSELF SAID TO ME IT IS SINFUL IT IS VERY WRONG IT IS SHAMEFUL
3607-29116-0045 HEAVEN PROTECT ME FROM SUCH A CHARGE THAT IS WHAT DILWORTHY SAID AND YET WHEN YOU COME TO LOOK AT IT YOU CANNOT DENY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT THE SERVICES OF SOME OF OUR ABLEST MEN SIR IF THE COUNTRY WERE OPPOSED TO TO BRIBERY IT IS A HARSH TERM I DO NOT LIKE TO USE IT
3664-11714-0000 HE HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT THE DRAUGHTS CONTAINING DISSOLVED PEARLS WHICH THE QUACK DOCTOR LEONI DI SPOLETO PRESCRIBED FOR HIM AS IF HE DESIRED TO ADAPT HIS REMEDIES RATHER TO THE RICHES OF HIS PATIENT THAN TO HIS NECESSITIES
3664-11714-0001 WERE USELESS AND UNAVAILING AND SO HE HAD COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE MUST PART FROM THOSE GENTLE TONGUED WOMEN OF HIS THOSE SWEET VOICED POETS HIS PALACES AND THEIR RICH HANGINGS THEREFORE HE HAD SUMMONED TO GIVE HIM ABSOLUTION FOR HIS SINS
3664-11714-0002 IN A MAN OF LESS HIGH PLACE THEY MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN CALLED CRIMES THE DOMINICAN GIRALAMO FRANCESCO SAVONAROLA IT WAS NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT AN INWARD FEAR AGAINST WHICH THE PRAISES OF HIS FRIENDS AVAILED NOTHING
3664-11714-0003 THAT THE PLEASURE SEEKER AND USURPER AWAITED THAT SEVERE AND GLOOMY PREACHER BY WHOSE WORDS ALL FLORENCE WAS STIRRED AND ON WHOSE PARDON HENCEFORTH DEPENDED ALL HIS HOPE FOR ANOTHER WORLD INDEED SAVONAROLA WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN OF STONE
3664-11714-0004 COMING LIKE THE STATUE OF THE COMMANDANTE TO KNOCK AT THE DOOR OF A DON GIOVANNI AND IN THE MIDST OF FEAST AND ORGY TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS EVEN NOW THE MOMENT TO BEGIN TO THINK OF HEAVEN HE HAD BEEN BORN AT FERRARA
3664-11714-0005 HAD FLED FROM HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND HAD TAKEN THE VOWS IN THE CLOISTER OF DOMINICAN MONKS AT FLORENCE THERE WHERE HE WAS APPOINTED BY HIS SUPERIORS TO GIVE LESSONS IN PHILOSOPHY THE YOUNG NOVICE HAD FROM THE FIRST TO BATTLE AGAINST THE DEFECTS OF A VOICE THAT WAS BOTH HARSH AND WEAK
3664-11714-0006 A DEFECTIVE PRONUNCIATION AND ABOVE ALL THE DEPRESSION OF HIS PHYSICAL POWERS EXHAUSTED AS THEY WERE BY TOO SEVERE ABSTINENCE SAVONAROLA FROM THAT TIME CONDEMNED HIMSELF TO THE MOST ABSOLUTE SECLUSION AND DISAPPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS CONVENT
3664-11714-0007 AS IF THE SLAB OF HIS TOMB HAD ALREADY FALLEN OVER HIM THERE KNEELING ON THE FLAGS PRAYING UNCEASINGLY BEFORE A WOODEN CRUCIFIX FEVERED BY VIGILS AND PENANCES HE SOON PASSED OUT OF CONTEMPLATION INTO ECSTASY AND BEGAN TO FEEL IN HIMSELF
3664-11714-0008 THAT INWARD PROPHETIC IMPULSE WHICH SUMMONED HIM TO PREACH THE REFORMATION OF THE CHURCH NEVERTHELESS THE REFORMATION OF SAVONAROLA MORE REVERENTIAL THAN LUTHER'S WHICH FOLLOWED ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS LATER RESPECTED THE THING WHILE ATTACKING THE MAN
3664-11714-0009 AND HAD AS ITS AIM THE ALTERING OF TEACHING THAT WAS HUMAN NOT FAITH THAT WAS OF GOD HE DID NOT WORK LIKE THE GERMAN MONK BY REASONING BUT BY ENTHUSIASM WITH HIM LOGIC ALWAYS GAVE WAY BEFORE INSPIRATION HE WAS NOT A THEOLOGIAN
3664-11714-0010 BUT A PROPHET YET ALTHOUGH HITHERTO HE HAD BOWED HIS HEAD BEFORE THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH HE HAD ALREADY RAISED IT AGAINST THE TEMPORAL POWER TO HIM RELIGION AND LIBERTY APPEARED AS TWO VIRGINS EQUALLY SACRED
3664-11714-0011 THE RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT SO LONG AS LORENZO LIVED IN RICHES HAPPINESS AND MAGNIFICENCE SAVONAROLA HAD NEVER BEEN WILLING WHATEVER ENTREATIES WERE MADE TO SANCTION BY HIS PRESENCE A POWER WHICH HE CONSIDERED ILLEGITIMATE
3664-11714-0012 BUT LORENZO ON HIS DEATHBED SENT FOR HIM AND THAT WAS ANOTHER MATTER THE AUSTERE PREACHER SET FORTH AT ONCE BAREHEADED AND BAREFOOT HOPING TO SAVE NOT ONLY THE SOUL OF THE DYING MAN BUT ALSO THE LIBERTY OF THE REPUBLIC
3664-11714-0013 LORENZO AS WE HAVE SAID WAS AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF SAVONAROLA WITH AN IMPATIENCE MIXED WITH UNEASINESS SO THAT WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF HIS STEPS HIS PALE FACE TOOK A YET MORE DEATHLIKE TINGE
3664-11714-0014 APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD WHEN HE PERCEIVED HIM LORENZO DEI MEDICI READING IN HIS MARBLE BROW THE INFLEXIBILITY OF A STATUE FELL BACK ON HIS BED BREATHING A SIGH SO PROFOUND THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED IT WAS HIS LAST
3664-11714-0015 THEN HE ADVANCED WITH A SLOW AND SOLEMN STEP TOWARDS THE BED LORENZO WATCHED HIS APPROACH WITH TERROR THEN WHEN HE WAS CLOSE BESIDE HIM HE CRIED O MY FATHER I HAVE BEEN A VERY GREAT SINNER THE MERCY OF GOD IS INFINITE REPLIED THE MONK
3664-11714-0016 YOU BELIEVE THEN THAT GOD WILL FORGIVE MY SINS CRIED THE DYING MAN RENEWING HIS HOPE AS HE HEARD FROM THE LIPS OF THE MONK SUCH UNEXPECTED WORDS YOUR SINS AND ALSO YOUR CRIMES GOD WILL FORGIVE THEM ALL REPLIED SAVONAROLA
3664-11714-0017 GOD WILL FORGIVE YOUR VANITIES YOUR ADULTEROUS PLEASURES YOUR OBSCENE FESTIVALS SO MUCH FOR YOUR SINS
3664-11714-0018 FRANCESCO FRESCOBALDI AND MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED OTHERS WHOSE NAMES WERE NONE THE LESS DEAR TO FLORENCE BECAUSE THEY WERE LESS RENOWNED SO MUCH FOR YOUR CRIMES AND AT EACH OF THESE NAMES WHICH SAVONAROLA PRONOUNCED SLOWLY HIS EYES FIXED ON THE DYING MAN
3664-11714-0019 HE REPLIED WITH A GROAN WHICH PROVED THE MONK'S MEMORY TO BE ONLY TOO TRUE THEN AT LAST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED LORENZO ASKED IN A DOUBTFUL TONE THEN DO YOU BELIEVE MY FATHER THAT GOD WILL FORGIVE ME EVERYTHING BOTH MY SINS AND MY CRIMES
3664-11714-0020 EVERYTHING SAID SAVONAROLA BUT ON THREE CONDITIONS WHAT ARE THEY ASKED THE DYING MAN THE FIRST SAID SAVONAROLA IS THAT YOU FEEL A COMPLETE FAITH IN THE POWER AND THE MERCY OF GOD
3664-11714-0021 MY FATHER REPLIED LORENZO EAGERLY I FEEL THIS FAITH IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF MY HEART THE SECOND SAID SAVONAROLA IS THAT YOU GIVE BACK THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS WHICH YOU HAVE UNJUSTLY CONFISCATED AND KEPT
3664-11714-0022 MY FATHER SHALL I HAVE TIME ASKED THE DYING MAN GOD WILL GIVE IT TO YOU REPLIED THE MONK
3664-11714-0023 EXCLAIMED LORENZO FALLING BACK ON HIS BED AND SHAKING HIS HEAD NEVER THE MONK WITHOUT REPLYING A SINGLE WORD MADE A STEP TO WITHDRAW MY FATHER MY FATHER SAID THE DYING MAN DO NOT LEAVE ME THUS HAVE PITY ON ME HAVE PITY ON FLORENCE SAID THE MONK
3664-11714-0024 BUT MY FATHER CRIED LORENZO FLORENCE IS FREE FLORENCE IS HAPPY FLORENCE IS A SLAVE FLORENCE IS POOR CRIED SAVONAROLA POOR IN GENIUS POOR IN MONEY AND POOR IN COURAGE POOR IN GENIUS BECAUSE AFTER YOU LORENZO
3664-11714-0025 WILL COME YOUR SON PIERO POOR IN MONEY BECAUSE FROM THE FUNDS OF THE REPUBLIC YOU HAVE KEPT UP THE MAGNIFICENCE OF YOUR FAMILY AND THE CREDIT OF YOUR BUSINESS HOUSES POOR IN COURAGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE ROBBED THE RIGHTFUL MAGISTRATES OF THE AUTHORITY WHICH WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY THEIRS
3664-11714-0026 AND DIVERTED THE CITIZENS FROM THE DOUBLE PATH OF MILITARY AND CIVIL LIFE WHEREIN BEFORE THEY WERE ENERVATED BY YOUR LUXURIES THEY HAD DISPLAYED THE VIRTUES OF THE ANCIENTS AND THEREFORE WHEN THE DAY SHALL DAWN WHICH IS NOT FAR DISTANT CONTINUED THE MONK
3664-11714-0027 IT IS NOT I WHO DESIRE IT IT IS THE LORD REPLIED SAVONAROLA COLDLY IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE MURMURED LORENZO VERY WELL THEN DIE AS YOU HAVE LIVED CRIED THE MONK IN THE MIDST OF YOUR COURTIERS AND FLATTERERS
3664-11714-0028 LET THEM RUIN YOUR SOUL AS THEY HAVE RUINED YOUR BODY AND AT THESE WORDS THE AUSTERE DOMINICAN WITHOUT LISTENING TO THE CRIES OF THE DYING MAN LEFT THE ROOM AS HE HAD ENTERED IT WITH FACE AND STEP UNALTERED FAR ABOVE HUMAN THINGS HE SEEMED TO SOAR
3664-11714-0029 A SPIRIT ALREADY DETACHED FROM THE EARTH AT THE CRY WHICH BROKE FROM LORENZO DEI MEDICI WHEN HE SAW HIM DISAPPEAR
3664-11714-0030 AND FOUND THEIR FRIEND CONVULSIVELY CLUTCHING IN HIS ARMS A MAGNIFICENT CRUCIFIX WHICH HE HAD JUST TAKEN DOWN FROM THE BED HEAD IN VAIN DID THEY TRY TO REASSURE HIM WITH FRIENDLY WORDS LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT ONLY REPLIED WITH SOBS
