7113-86041-0030 THEY SAW AT LAST THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO CARRY TO THE KING THE SAD TIDINGS OF HIS BELOVED DAUGHTER'S DISAPPEARANCE AND WHAT GREAT WEEPING AND LAMENTATION THERE WAS IN THE PALACE WHEN THE DREADFUL NEWS WAS TOLD
7113-86041-0031 THE SCENE OF THIS STRANGE ADVENTURE THINKING AS PEOPLE WILL IN SORROW THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME MISTAKE AFTER ALL BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT BEHOLD ALL WAS CHANGED AGAIN
7113-86041-0032 THE GLITTERING GROTTO DESCRIBED TO HIM BY THE MAIDENS HAD COMPLETELY VANISHED AND SO HAD THE MARBLE BATH THE BOWER OF JASMINE INSTEAD ALL WAS A TANGLE OF FLOWERS AS IT HAD BEEN OF OLD
7113-86041-0033 THE KING WAS SO MUCH PERPLEXED THAT HE THREATENED THE PRINCESS'S PLAYFELLOWS WITH ALL SORTS OF PUNISHMENTS IF THEY WOULD NOT CONFESS SOMETHING ABOUT HER DISAPPEARANCE BUT AS THEY ONLY REPEATED THE SAME STORY HE PRESENTLY PUT DOWN THE WHOLE AFFAIR TO THE WORK OF SOME
7113-86041-0034 SPRITE OR GOBLIN AND TRIED TO CONSOLE HIMSELF FOR HIS LOSS BY ORDERING A GRAND HUNT FOR KINGS CANNOT BEAR TO BE TROUBLED ABOUT ANYTHING LONG MEANWHILE THE PRINCESS WAS NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY
7113-86041-0035 THEY SWAM WITH HER QUICKLY BY STRANGE UNDERGROUND WAYS TO A PALACE SO SPLENDID THAT HER FATHER'S SEEMED BUT A POOR COTTAGE IN COMPARISON WITH IT AND WHEN SHE RECOVERED FROM HER ASTONISHMENT SHE FOUND HERSELF SEATED UPON A COUCH
7113-86041-0036 WRAPPED IN A WONDERFUL ROBE OF SATIN FASTENED WITH A SILKEN GIRDLE WHILE BESIDE HER KNELT A YOUNG MAN WHO WHISPERED THE SWEETEST SPEECHES IMAGINABLE IN HER EAR THE GNOME FOR HE IT WAS TOLD HER ALL ABOUT HIMSELF
7113-86041-0037 AND HIS GREAT UNDERGROUND KINGDOM AND PRESENTLY LED HER THROUGH THE MANY ROOMS AND HALLS OF THE PALACE AND SHOWED HER THE RARE AND WONDERFUL THINGS DISPLAYED IN THEM TILL SHE WAS FAIRLY DAZZLED AT THE SIGHT OF SO MUCH SPLENDOUR
7113-86041-0038 ON THREE SIDES OF THE CASTLE LAY A LOVELY GARDEN WITH MASSES OF GAY SWEET FLOWERS AND VELVET LAWNS ALL COOL AND SHADY WHICH PLEASED THE EYE OF THE PRINCESS THE FRUIT TREES WERE HUNG WITH GOLDEN AND ROSY APPLES
7113-86041-0039 AND NIGHTINGALES SANG IN EVERY BUSH AS THE GNOME AND THE PRINCESS WANDERED IN THE LEAFY ALLEYS SOMETIMES GAZING AT THE MOON SOMETIMES PAUSING TO GATHER THE RAREST FLOWERS FOR HER ADORNMENT
7113-86041-0040 BUT THE PRINCESS FELT NO SUCH HAPPINESS IN SPITE OF ALL THE MAGIC DELIGHTS AROUND HER SHE WAS SAD THOUGH SHE TRIED TO SEEM CONTENT FOR FEAR OF DISPLEASING THE GNOME HOWEVER HE SOON PERCEIVED HER MELANCHOLY
7113-86041-0041 AND IN A THOUSAND WAYS STROVE TO DISPEL THE CLOUD BUT IN VAIN AT LAST HE SAID TO HIMSELF MEN ARE SOCIABLE CREATURES LIKE BEES OR ANTS
7113-86041-0042 WHO IS THERE I CAN FIND FOR HER TO TALK TO
7113-86041-0043 CARROTS TURNIPS AND RADISHES AND LAYING THEM CAREFULLY IN AN ELEGANT BASKET BROUGHT THEM TO THE PRINCESS WHO SAT PENSIVE IN THE SHADE OF THE ROSE BOWER LOVELIEST DAUGHTER OF EARTH SAID THE GNOME BANISH ALL SORROW
7113-86041-0044 NO MORE SHALL YOU BE LONELY IN MY DWELLING
7113-86041-0045 TAKE THIS LITTLE MANY COLOURED WAND AND WITH A TOUCH GIVE TO EACH ROOT THE FORM YOU DESIRE TO SEE WITH THIS HE LEFT HER AND THE PRINCESS WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S DELAY OPENED THE BASKET
7113-86041-0046 THIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE WAS SO DELIGHTFUL THAT THE PRINCESS COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HER OWN EYES AND WAS QUITE BESIDE HERSELF WITH THE JOY OF HAVING HER DEAR PLAYFELLOW WITH HER ONCE MORE HAND IN HAND THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE ENCHANTED GARDEN
7113-86041-0047 AND GATHERED THE GOLDEN APPLES FROM THE TREES AND WHEN THEY WERE TIRED OF THIS AMUSEMENT THE PRINCESS LED HER FRIEND THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL ROOMS OF THE PALACE UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE ONE IN WHICH WERE KEPT ALL THE MARVELLOUS DRESSES AND ORNAMENTS
7113-86041-0048 THE GNOME HAD GIVEN TO HIS HOPED FOR BRIDE THERE THEY FOUND SO MUCH TO AMUSE THEM THAT THE HOURS PASSED LIKE MINUTES VEILS GIRDLES AND NECKLACES WERE TRIED ON AND ADMIRED
7113-86041-0049 AND SHOWED SO MUCH TASTE THAT NOBODY
7113-86041-0050 THE GNOME WHO HAD SECRETLY BEEN KEEPING AN EYE UPON THEM WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING SO WELL UNDERSTOOD THE HEART OF A WOMAN AND THE PRINCESS SEEMED TO HIM EVEN MORE CHARMING THAN BEFORE
7113-86041-0051 SHE DID NOT FORGET TO TOUCH THE REST OF THE ROOTS WITH HER MAGIC WAND AND SOON HAD ALL HER MAIDENS ABOUT HER AND EVEN AS SHE HAD TWO TINY RADISHES TO SPARE
7113-86041-0052 WHOSE NAME WAS BENI AND NOW ALL WENT CHEERFULLY IN THE CASTLE THE PRINCESS GAVE TO EACH OF THE MAIDENS HER TASK AND NEVER WAS MISTRESS BETTER SERVED FOR A WHOLE WEEK SHE ENJOYED THE DELIGHT OF HER PLEASANT COMPANY UNDISTURBED
7113-86041-0053 THEY PLAYED FROM MORNING TO NIGHT ONLY THE PRINCESS NOTICED THAT DAY BY DAY THE FRESH YOUNG FACES OF HER MAIDENS GREW PALE AND WAN AND THE MIRROR IN THE GREAT MARBLE HALL SHOWED HER THAT SHE ALONE STILL KEPT HER ROSY BLOOM
7113-86041-0054 WHILE BRUNHILDA AND THE REST FADED VISIBLY THEY ASSURED HER THAT ALL WAS WELL WITH THEM BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY CONTINUED TO WASTE AWAY
7113-86041-0055 TAKE PART IN THE GAMES OF THE PRINCESS TILL AT LAST ONE FINE MORNING WHEN THE PRINCESS STARTED FROM BED AND HASTENED OUT TO JOIN HER GAY PLAYFELLOWS SHE SHUDDERED
7113-86041-0056 AND STARTED BACK AT THE SIGHT OF A GROUP OF SHRIVELLED CRONES WITH BENT BACKS AND TREMBLING LIMBS WHO SUPPORTED THEIR TOTTERING STEPS WITH STAVES AND CRUTCHES AND COUGHED DISMALLY A LITTLE NEARER TO THE HEARTH
7113-86041-0057 LAY THE ONCE FROLICSOME BENI WITH ALL FOUR FEET STRETCHED STIFFLY OUT WHILE THE SLEEK CAT SEEMED TOO WEAK TO RAISE HIS HEAD FROM HIS VELVET CUSHION THE HORRIFIED PRINCESS FLED TO THE DOOR
7113-86041-0058 THE GREATEST DELIGHT OF MY LONELY HOURS ISN'T THIS SOLITARY LIFE IN SUCH A DESERT BAD ENOUGH WITHOUT YOUR TURNING THE CASTLE INTO A HOSPITAL FOR THE AGED GIVE MY MAIDENS BACK THEIR YOUTH AND HEALTH THIS VERY MINUTE OR I WILL NEVER LOVE YOU
7113-86041-0059 SWEETEST AND FAIREST OF DAMSELS CRIED THE GNOME DO NOT BE ANGRY EVERYTHING THAT IS IN MY POWER I WILL DO BUT DO NOT ASK THE IMPOSSIBLE SO LONG AS THE SAP WAS FRESH IN THE ROOTS
7113-86041-0060 THE MAGIC STAFF COULD KEEP THEM IN THE FORMS YOU DESIRED BUT AS THE SAP DRIED UP THEY WITHERED AWAY BUT NEVER TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT THAT DEAREST ONE A BASKET OF FRESH TURNIPS WILL SOON SET MATTERS RIGHT
7113-86041-0061 AND YOU CAN SPEEDILY CALL UP AGAIN EVERY FORM YOU WISH TO SEE THE GREAT GREEN PATCH IN THE GARDEN WILL PROVE YOU WITH A MORE LIVELY COMPANY SO SAYING THE GNOME TOOK HIMSELF OFF
7113-86041-0062 AND THE PRINCESS WITH HER MAGIC WAND TOUCHED THE WRINKLED OLD WOMEN AND LEFT THEM THE WITHERED ROOTS THEY REALLY WERE TO BE THROWN UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP AND WITH LIGHT FEET SKIPPED OFF ACROSS TO THE MEADOW
7113-86041-0063 TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE FRESHLY FILLED BASKET BUT TO HER SURPRISE SHE COULD NOT FIND IT ANYWHERE UP AND DOWN THE GARDEN SHE SEARCHED SPYING INTO EVERY CORNER BUT NOT A SIGN OF IT WAS TO BE FOUND
7113-86041-0064 BY THE TRELLIS OF GRAPE VINES SHE MET THE GNOME WHO WAS SO MUCH EMBARRASSED AT THE SIGHT OF HER THAT SHE BECAME AWARE OF HIS CONFUSION WHILE HE WAS STILL QUITE A LONG WAY OFF
7113-86041-0065 DEAR QUEEN OF MY HEART ANSWERED HE I PRAY YOU TO FORGIVE MY CARELESSNESS I PROMISED MORE THAN I COULD PERFORM I HAVE SOUGHT ALL OVER THE LAND FOR THE ROOTS YOU DESIRE BUT THEY ARE GATHERED IN AND LIE DRYING IN MUSTY CELLARS
7113-86041-0066 AND THE FIELDS ARE BARE AND DESOLATE FOR BELOW IN THE VALLEY WINTER REIGNS ONLY HERE IN YOUR PRESENCE SPRING IS HELD FAST AND WHEREVER YOUR FOOT IS SET THE GAY FLOWERS BLOOM HAVE PATIENCE FOR A LITTLE
7113-86041-0067 AND THEN WITHOUT FAIL YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR PUPPETS TO PLAY WITH ALMOST BEFORE THE GNOME HAD FINISHED THE DISAPPOINTED PRINCESS TURNED AWAY AND MARCHED OFF TO HER OWN APARTMENTS WITHOUT DEIGNING TO ANSWER HIM THE GNOME HOWEVER
7113-86041-0068 AND DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A FARMER BOUGHT AN ASS IN THE NEAREST MARKET TOWN AND BROUGHT IT BACK LOADED WITH SACKS OF TURNIP CARROT AND RADISH SEED WITH THIS HE SOWED A GREAT FIELD
7113-86041-0069 AND SENT A VAST ARMY OF HIS GOBLINS TO WATCH AND TEND IT AND TO BRING UP THE FIERY RIVERS FROM THE HEART OF THE EARTH NEAR ENOUGH TO WARM AND ENCOURAGE THE SPROUTING SEEDS THUS FOSTERED THEY GREW AND FLOURISHED MARVELLOUSLY
7113-86041-0070 HE IMAGINED THAT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED TO CARE FOR HIM BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE FOR THE TRUTH WAS THAT ANOTHER IMAGE ALREADY FILLED HER HEART THE YOUNG PRINCE RATIBOR WHOSE LANDS JOINED HER FATHER'S HAD WON THE HEART OF THE PRINCESS
7113-86041-0071 LOOKING FORWARD TO THE COMING OF THEIR WEDDING DAY WHEN THE BRIDE'S MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE TOOK PLACE THE SAD NEWS DROVE RATIBOR DISTRACTED AND AS THE DAYS WENT ON AND NOTHING COULD BE HEARD OF THE PRINCESS HE FORSOOK HIS CASTLE
7113-86041-0072 AND THE SOCIETY OF MEN AND SPENT HIS DAYS IN THE WILD FORESTS ROAMING ABOUT AND CRYING HER NAME ALOUD TO THE TREES AND ROCKS MEANWHILE THE MAIDEN IN HER GORGEOUS PRISON SIGHED IN SECRET OVER HER GRIEF NOT WISHING TO AROUSE THE GNOME'S SUSPICIONS
7113-86041-0073 IN HER OWN MIND SHE WAS WONDERING IF BY ANY MEANS SHE MIGHT ESCAPE FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND AT LAST SHE HIT UPON A PLAN BY THIS TIME SPRING ONCE MORE REIGNED IN THE VALLEY AND THE GNOME SENT THE FIRES BACK TO THEIR PLACES IN THE DEEPS OF THE EARTH
7113-86041-0074 FOR THE ROOTS WHICH THEY HAD KEPT WARM THROUGH ALL THE CRUEL WINTER HAND NOW COME TO THEIR FULL SIZE DAY BY DAY THE PRINCESS PULLED UP SOME OF THEM AND MADE EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM CONJURING UP NOW THIS LONGED FOR PERSON AND NOW THAT
7113-86041-0075 JUST FOR THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM AS THEY APPEARED BUT SHE REALLY HAD ANOTHER PURPOSE IN VIEW ONE DAY SHE CHANGED A TINY TURNIP INTO A BEE AND SENT HIM OFF TO BRING HER SOME NEWS OF HER LOVER FLY
7113-86041-0076 SO THE BEE SPREAD HIS SHINING WINGS AND FLEW AWAY TO DO AS HE WAS BIDDEN BUT BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT A GREEDY SWALLOW MADE A SNATCH AT HIM AND TO THE GREAT GRIEF OF THE PRINCESS HER MESSENGER WAS EATEN UP
7113-86041-0077 THEN AND THERE AFTER THAT BY THE POWER OF THE WONDERFUL WAND SHE SUMMONED A CRICKET AND TAUGHT HIM THIS GREETING HOP LITTLE CRICKET TO RATIBOR AND CHIRP IN HIS EAR THAT I LOVE HIM ONLY
7113-86041-0078 BUT THAT I AM HELD CAPTIVE BY THE GNOME IN HIS PALACE UNDER THE MOUNTAINS SO THE CRICKET HOPPED OFF GAILY DETERMINED TO DO HIS BEST TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGE BUT ALAS A LONG LEGGED STORK WHO WAS PRANCING ALONG THE SAME ROAD
7113-86041-0079 CAUGHT HIM IN HER CRUEL BEAK AND BEFORE HE COULD SAY A WORD HE HAD DISAPPEARED DOWN HER THROAT THESE TWO UNLUCKY VENTURES DID NOT PREVENT THE PRINCESS FROM TRYING ONCE MORE
7113-86041-0080 THIS TIME SHE CHANGED THE TURNIP INTO A MAGPIE FLUTTER FROM TREE TO TREE CHATTERING BIRD SAID SHE TILL YOU COME TO RATIBOR MY LOVE
7113-86041-0081 AND BID HIM COME WITH HORSES AND MEN THE THIRD DAY FROM THIS TO THE HILL THAT RISES FROM THE THORNY VALLEY THE MAGPIE LISTENED HOPPED AWHILE FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH AND THEN DARTED AWAY
7113-86041-0082 NOW PRINCE RATIBOR WAS STILL SPENDING HIS LIFE IN WANDERING ABOUT THE WOODS AND NOT EVEN THE BEAUTY OF THE SPRING COULD SOOTHE HIS GRIEF ONE DAY AS HE SAT IN THE SHADE OF AN OAK TREE DREAMING OF HIS LOST PRINCESS AND SOMETIMES CRYING HER NAME ALOUD
7113-86041-0083 WHICH BELONGS TO AN UNLUCKY MORTAL WHO WISHES THE EARTH WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW UP HIM AND HIS MEMORY FOR EVER THEREUPON HE CAUGHT UP A GREAT STONE
7113-86041-0084 BUT THE MAGPIE IN THE TREE WHO LIKE
7113-86041-0085 UNLESS HE COULD BE FOR EVER CHATTERING
7113-86041-0086 ALL HIS GLOOM AND MISERY VANISHED IN A MOMENT AND HE ANXIOUSLY QUESTIONED THE WELCOME MESSENGER AS TO THE FATE OF THE PRINCESS BUT THE MAGPIE KNEW NO MORE THAN THE LESSON HE HAD LEARNT SO HE SOON FLUTTERED AWAY
7113-86041-0087 WHILE THE PRINCE HURRIED BACK TO HIS CASTLE TO GATHER TOGETHER A TROOP OF HORSEMEN FULL OF COURAGE FOR WHATEVER MIGHT BEFALL THE PRINCESS MEANWHILE WAS CRAFTILY PURSUING HER PLAN OF ESCAPE
7113-86041-0088 SHE LEFT OFF TREATING THE GNOME WITH COLDNESS AND INDIFFERENCE INDEED THERE WAS A LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT SOME DAY RETURN HIS LOVE AND THE IDEA PLEASED HIM MIGHTILY THE NEXT DAY
7113-86041-0089 AS SOON AS THE SUN ROSE SHE MADE HER APPEARANCE DECKED AS A BRIDE IN THE WONDERFUL ROBES AND JEWELS WHICH THE FOND GNOME HAD PREPARED FOR HER HER GOLDEN HAIR WAS BRAIDED AND CROWNED WITH MYRTLE BLOSSOMS
7113-86041-0090 AND HER FLOWING VEIL SPARKLED WITH GEMS IN THESE MAGNIFICENT GARMENTS SHE WENT TO MEET THE GNOME UPON THE GREAT TERRACE LOVELIEST OF MAIDENS HE STAMMERED BOWING LOW BEFORE HER LET ME GAZE INTO YOUR DEAR EYES
7113-86041-0091 YOUR CONSTANCY HAS OVERCOME ME SHE SAID I CAN NO LONGER OPPOSE YOUR WISHES BUT BELIEVE MY WORDS AND SUFFER THIS VEIL STILL TO HIDE MY BLUSHES AND TEARS WHY TEARS BELOVED ONE CRIED THE GNOME ANXIOUSLY
7113-86041-0092 EVERY TEAR OF YOURS FALLS UPON MY HEART LIKE A DROP OF MOLTEN GOLD GREATLY AS I DESIRE YOUR LOVE I DO NOT ASK A SACRIFICE AH CRIED THE FALSE PRINCESS WHY DO YOU MISUNDERSTAND MY TEARS
7113-86041-0093 AND YET I AM FEARFUL A WIFE CANNOT ALWAYS CHARM AND THOUGH YOU WILL NEVER ALTER THE BEAUTY OF MORTALS IS AS A FLOWER THAT FADES HOW CAN I BE SURE THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE AS LOVING AND CHARMING AS YOU ARE NOW
7113-86041-0094 ASK SOME PROOF SWEETHEART SAID HE PUT MY OBEDIENCE AND MY PATIENCE TO SOME TEST BY WHICH YOU CAN JUDGE OF MY UNALTERABLE LOVE BE IT SO ANSWERED THE CRAFTY MAIDEN THEN GIVE ME
7113-86041-0095 THAT SHALL BE THE TEST OF YOUR TRUTH TOWARDS ME UNWILLING AS THE GNOME WAS TO LOSE SIGHT OF HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE FOR A MOMENT HE OBEYED HER COMMANDS WITHOUT DELAY AND HURRIED OFF TO BEGIN HIS TASK
7113-86041-0096 HE SKIPPED ALONG AMONG THE TURNIPS AS NIMBLE AS A GRASSHOPPER AND HAD SOON COUNTED THEM ALL BUT TO BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT HE HAD MADE NO MISTAKE HE THOUGHT HE WOULD JUST RUN OVER THEM AGAIN
7113-86041-0097 THIS TIME TO HIS GREAT ANNOYANCE THE NUMBER WAS DIFFERENT SO HE RECKONED THEM FOR THE THIRD TIME BUT NOW THE NUMBER WAS NOT THE SAME AS EITHER OF THE PREVIOUS ONES AND THIS WAS HARDLY TO BE WONDERED AT AS HIS MIND WAS FULL OF THE PRINCESS'S
7113-86041-0098 PRETTY LOOKS AND WORDS AS FOR THE MAIDEN NO SOONER WAS HER DELUDED LOVER FAIRLY OUT OF SIGHT THAN SHE BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR FLIGHT SHE HAD A FINE FRESH TURNIP HIDDEN CLOSE AT HAND
7113-86041-0099 WHICH SHE CHANGED INTO A SPIRITED HORSE ALL SADDLED AND BRIDLED AND SPRINGING UPON ITS BACK SHE GALLOPED AWAY OVER HILL AND DALE TILL SHE REACHED THE THORNY VALLEY AND FLUNG HERSELF
7113-86041-0100 INTO THE ARMS OF HER BELOVED PRINCE RATIBOR MEANWHILE THE TOILING GNOME WENT THROUGH HIS TASK OVER AND OVER AGAIN TILL HIS BACK ACHED AND HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE COULD NO LONGER PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
7113-86041-0101 BUT AS HE FELT TOLERABLY CERTAIN OF THE EXACT NUMBER OF TURNIPS IN THE FIELD BIG AND LITTLE TOGETHER HE HURRIED BACK EAGER TO PROVE TO HIS BELOVED ONE WHAT A DELIGHTFUL AND SUBMISSIVE HUSBAND HE WOULD BE HE FELT VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF
7113-86041-0102 AS HE CROSSED THE MOSSY LAWN TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER BUT ALAS SHE WAS NO LONGER THERE HE SEARCHED EVERY THICKET AND PATH HE LOOKED BEHIND EVERY TREE AND GAZED INTO EVERY POND
7113-86041-0103 BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS THEN HE HASTENED INTO THE PALACE AND RUSHED FROM ROOM TO ROOM PEERING INTO EVERY HOLE AND CORNER AND CALLING HER BY NAME BUT ONLY
7113-86041-0104 ECHO ANSWERED IN THE MARBLE HALLS THERE WAS NEITHER VOICE NOR FOOTSTEP THEN HE BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS AND THROWING OFF THE MORTAL FORM THAT ENCUMBERED HIM HE FLEW OUT OF THE PALACE
7113-86041-0105 AND SOARED HIGH INTO THE AIR AND SAW THE FUGITIVE PRINCESS IN THE FAR DISTANCE JUST AS THE SWIFT HORSE CARRIED HER ACROSS THE BOUNDARY OF HIS DOMINIONS FURIOUSLY
7113-86041-0106 AND HURL A THUNDERBOLT AFTER THE FLYING MAIDEN SPLINTERING THE ROCKY BARRIERS WHICH HAD STOOD A THOUSAND YEARS BUT HIS FURY WAS VAIN THE THUNDERCLOUDS MELTED AWAY INTO A SOFT MIST
7113-86041-0107 AND THE GNOME AFTER FLYING ABOUT FOR A WHILE IN DESPAIR BEWAILING TO THE FOUR WINDS HIS UNHAPPY FATE WENT SORROWFULLY BACK TO THE PALACE AND STOLE ONCE MORE THROUGH EVERY ROOM WITH MANY SIGHS AND LAMENTATIONS
7113-86041-0108 HE PASSED THROUGH THE GARDENS WHICH FOR HIM HAD LOST THEIR CHARM AND THE SIGHT OF THE PRINCESS'S FOOTPRINTS ON THE GOLDEN SAND OF THE PATHWAY RENEWED HIS GRIEF ALL WAS LONELY EMPTY SORROWFUL
7113-86041-0109 AND THE FORSAKEN GNOME RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO MORE DEALINGS WITH SUCH FALSE CREATURES
7113-86041-0110 TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS UNDERGROUND KINGDOM
7178-34644-0000 THE DURABILITY OF FRAGILE THINGS DESTINY SOMETIMES PROFFERS US A GLASS OF MADNESS TO DRINK A HAND IS THRUST OUT OF THE MIST AND SUDDENLY HANDS US THE MYSTERIOUS CUP IN WHICH IS CONTAINED THE LATENT INTOXICATION
7178-34644-0001 GWYNPLAINE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM TO SEE WHO IT WAS WHO HAD BEEN ADDRESSED A SOUND MAY BE TOO SHARP TO BE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE EAR
7178-34644-0002 AN EMOTION TOO ACUTE CONVEYS NO MEANING TO THE MIND THERE IS A LIMIT TO COMPREHENSION AS WELL AS TO HEARING THE WAPENTAKE AND THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM APPROACHED GWYNPLAINE AND TOOK HIM BY THE ARMS
7178-34644-0003 HE FELT HIMSELF PLACED IN THE CHAIR WHICH THE SHERIFF HAD JUST VACATED HE LET IT BE DONE WITHOUT SEEKING AN EXPLANATION WHEN GWYNPLAINE WAS SEATED THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM AND THE WAPENTAKE RETIRED A FEW STEPS
7178-34644-0004 AND STOOD UPRIGHT AND MOTIONLESS BEHIND THE SEAT THEN THE SHERIFF PLACED HIS BUNCH OF ROSES ON THE STONE TABLE PUT ON SPECTACLES WHICH THE SECRETARY GAVE HIM DREW FROM THE BUNDLES OF PAPERS WHICH COVERED THE TABLE A SHEET OF PARCHMENT
7178-34644-0005 YELLOW GREEN TORN AND JAGGED IN PLACES WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN FOLDED IN VERY SMALL FOLDS AND OF WHICH ONE SIDE WAS COVERED WITH WRITING STANDING UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP HE HELD THE SHEET CLOSE TO HIS EYES
7178-34644-0006 AND IN HIS MOST SOLEMN TONE READ AS FOLLOWS IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER THE SON AND THE HOLY GHOST THIS PRESENT DAY THE TWENTY NINTH OF JANUARY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINETIETH YEAR OF OUR LORD
7178-34644-0007 HAS BEEN WICKEDLY DESERTED ON THE DESERT COAST OF PORTLAND WITH THE INTENTION OF ALLOWING HIM TO PERISH OF HUNGER OF COLD AND OF SOLITUDE A CHILD TEN YEARS OLD
7178-34644-0008 THAT CHILD WAS SOLD AT THE AGE OF TWO YEARS BY ORDER OF HIS MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY KING JAMES THE SECOND THAT CHILD IS LORD FERMAIN CLANCHARLIE
7178-34644-0009 THE ONLY LEGITIMATE SON OF LORD LINNAEUS CLANCHARLIE BARON CLANCHARLIE AND HUNKERVILLE MARQUIS OF CORLEONE IN SICILY A PEER OF ENGLAND AND OF ANN BRADSHAW HIS WIFE BOTH DECEASED
7178-34644-0010 THAT CHILD IS THE INHERITOR OF THE ESTATES AND TITLES OF HIS FATHER FOR THIS REASON HE WAS SOLD MUTILATED DISFIGURED AND PUT OUT OF THE WAY BY DESIRE OF HIS MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY
7178-34644-0011 THAT CHILD WAS BROUGHT UP AND TRAINED TO BE A MOUNTEBANK AT MARKETS AND FAIRS HE WAS SOLD AT THE AGE OF TWO AFTER THE DEATH OF THE PEER HIS FATHER AND TEN POUNDS STERLING WERE GIVEN TO THE KING AS HIS PURCHASE MONEY
7178-34644-0012 AS WELL AS FOR DIVERS CONCESSIONS TOLERATIONS AND IMMUNITIES LORD FERMAIN CLANCHARLIE AT THE AGE OF TWO YEARS WAS BOUGHT BY ME THE UNDERSIGNED WHO WRITE THESE LINES AND MUTILATED
7178-34644-0013 AND DISFIGURED BY A FLEMING OF FLANDERS CALLED HARDQUANONNE WHO ALONE IS ACQUAINTED WITH THE SECRETS AND MODES OF TREATMENT OF DOCTOR CONQUEST THE CHILD WAS DESTINED BY US TO BE A LAUGHING MASK
7178-34644-0014 WHICH STAMPS AN EVERLASTING LAUGH UPON THE FACE THE CHILD BY MEANS KNOWN ONLY TO HARDQUANONNE WAS PUT TO SLEEP AND MADE INSENSIBLE DURING ITS PERFORMANCE KNOWING NOTHING OF THE OPERATION WHICH HE UNDERWENT
7178-34644-0015 HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE IS LORD CLANCHARLIE HE ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF GWYNPLAINE THIS FACT IS THE RESULT OF HIS YOUTH AND THE SLIGHT POWERS OF MEMORY HE COULD HAVE HAD WHEN HE WAS BOUGHT AND SOLD
7178-34644-0016 BEING THEN BARELY TWO YEARS OLD HARDQUANONNE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS HOW TO PERFORM THE OPERATION BUCCA FISSA AND THE SAID CHILD IS THE ONLY LIVING SUBJECT UPON WHICH IT HAS BEEN ESSAYED
7178-34644-0017 THE OPERATION IS SO UNIQUE AND SINGULAR THAT THOUGH AFTER LONG YEARS THIS CHILD SHOULD HAVE COME TO BE AN OLD MAN INSTEAD OF A CHILD AND HIS BLACK LOCKS SHOULD HAVE TURNED WHITE
