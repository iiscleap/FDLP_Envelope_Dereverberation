2893-139322-0022 IN SPITE OF EVERY PRECAUTION THE LABOUR POLICEMAN TOLD THEM IN A DEPRESSED TONE THE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT INFREQUENTLY ROBBED BEYOND WAS A GALLERY OF WOMEN BUSIED IN CUTTING AND SETTING SLABS OF ARTIFICIAL RUBY
2893-139322-0023 MANY OF THESE WORKERS HAD LIPS AND NOSTRILS A LIVID WHITE DUE TO A DISEASE CAUSED BY A PECULIAR PURPLE ENAMEL THAT CHANCED TO BE MUCH IN FASHION ASANO APOLOGISED TO GRAHAM FOR THIS OFFENSIVE SIGHT BUT EXCUSED HIMSELF ON THE SCORE OF THE CONVENIENCE OF THIS ROUTE
2893-139322-0024 THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE SAID GRAHAM THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE TRYING TO AVOID A START AT A PARTICULARLY STRIKING DISFIGUREMENT SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER WITH HERSELF THAN THAT SAID ASANO
2893-139322-0025 GRAHAM MADE SOME INDIGNANT COMMENTS BUT SIRE WE SIMPLY COULD NOT STAND THAT STUFF WITHOUT THE PURPLE SAID ASANO IN YOUR DAYS PEOPLE COULD STAND SUCH CRUDITIES THEY WERE NEARER THE BARBARIC BY TWO HUNDRED YEARS
2893-139322-0026 AND CAME TO A LITTLE BRIDGE THAT SPANNED A VAULT LOOKING OVER THE PARAPET GRAHAM SAW THAT BENEATH WAS A WHARF UNDER YET MORE TREMENDOUS ARCHINGS THAN ANY HE HAD SEEN THREE BARGES SMOTHERED IN FLOURY DUST WERE BEING UNLOADED OF THEIR CARGOES OF POWDERED FELSPAR
2893-139322-0027 BY A MULTITUDE OF COUGHING MEN EACH GUIDING A LITTLE TRUCK THE DUST FILLED THE PLACE WITH A CHOKING MIST AND TURNED THE ELECTRIC GLARE YELLOW THE VAGUE SHADOWS OF THESE WORKERS GESTICULATED ABOUT THEIR FEET AND RUSHED TO AND FRO AGAINST A LONG STRETCH OF WHITE WASHED WALL
2893-139322-0028 EVERY NOW AND THEN ONE WOULD STOP TO COUGH A SHADOWY HUGE MASS OF MASONRY RISING OUT OF THE INKY WATER BROUGHT TO GRAHAM'S MIND THE THOUGHT OF THE MULTITUDE OF WAYS AND GALLERIES AND LIFTS THAT ROSE FLOOR ABOVE FLOOR OVERHEAD BETWEEN HIM AND THE SKY
2893-139322-0029 THEIR FEET MADE A HOLLOW THUNDER ON THE PLANKS ALONG WHICH THEY WENT TO AND FRO AND AS HE LOOKED AT THIS SCENE SOME HIDDEN VOICE IN THE DARKNESS BEGAN TO SING STOP THAT SHOUTED ONE OF THE POLICEMEN BUT THE ORDER WAS DISOBEYED
2893-139322-0030 AND FIRST ONE AND THEN ALL THE WHITE STAINED MEN WHO WERE WORKING THERE HAD TAKEN UP THE BEATING REFRAIN SINGING IT DEFIANTLY THE SONG OF THE REVOLT THE FEET UPON THE PLANKS THUNDERED NOW TO THE RHYTHM OF THE SONG TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP
2893-139322-0031 THE POLICEMAN WHO HAD SHOUTED GLANCED AT HIS FELLOW AND GRAHAM SAW HIM SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS HE MADE NO FURTHER EFFORT TO STOP THE SINGING AND SO THEY WENT THROUGH THESE FACTORIES AND PLACES OF TOIL SEEING MANY PAINFUL AND GRIM THINGS
2893-139322-0032 THAT WALK LEFT ON GRAHAM'S MIND A MAZE OF MEMORIES FLUCTUATING PICTURES OF SWATHED HALLS AND CROWDED VAULTS SEEN THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST OF INTRICATE MACHINES THE RACING THREADS OF LOOMS THE HEAVY BEAT OF STAMPING MACHINERY
2893-139322-0033 THE ROAR AND RATTLE OF BELT AND ARMATURE OF ILL LIT SUBTERRANEAN AISLES OF SLEEPING PLACES ILLIMITABLE VISTAS OF PIN POINT LIGHTS HERE WAS THE SMELL OF TANNING AND HERE THE REEK OF A BREWERY
2893-139322-0034 AND HERE UNPRECEDENTED REEKS EVERYWHERE WERE PILLARS AND CROSS ARCHINGS OF SUCH A MASSIVENESS AS GRAHAM HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN THICK TITANS OF GREASY SHINING BRICKWORK CRUSHED BENEATH THE VAST WEIGHT OF THAT COMPLEX CITY WORLD
2893-139322-0035 EVEN AS THESE ANEMIC MILLIONS WERE CRUSHED BY ITS COMPLEXITY AND EVERYWHERE WERE PALE FEATURES LEAN LIMBS DISFIGUREMENT AND DEGRADATION ONCE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN A THIRD TIME
2893-139322-0036 GRAHAM HEARD THE SONG OF THE REVOLT DURING HIS LONG UNPLEASANT RESEARCH IN THESE PLACES AND ONCE HE SAW A CONFUSED STRUGGLE DOWN A PASSAGE AND LEARNT THAT A NUMBER OF THESE SERFS HAD SEIZED THEIR BREAD BEFORE THEIR WORK WAS DONE GRAHAM WAS ASCENDING TOWARDS THE WAYS AGAIN
2893-139322-0037 WHEN HE SAW A NUMBER OF BLUE CLAD CHILDREN RUNNING DOWN A TRANSVERSE PASSAGE AND PRESENTLY PERCEIVED THE REASON OF THEIR PANIC IN A COMPANY OF THE LABOUR POLICE ARMED WITH CLUBS TROTTING TOWARDS SOME UNKNOWN DISTURBANCE AND THEN CAME A REMOTE DISORDER
2893-139322-0038 BUT FOR THE MOST PART THIS REMNANT THAT WORKED WORKED HOPELESSLY ALL THE SPIRIT THAT WAS LEFT IN FALLEN HUMANITY WAS ABOVE IN THE STREETS THAT NIGHT CALLING FOR THE MASTER AND VALIANTLY AND NOISILY KEEPING ITS ARMS
2893-139322-0039 THEY EMERGED FROM THESE WANDERINGS AND STOOD BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MIDDLE PASSAGE OF THE PLATFORMS AGAIN THEY BECAME AWARE OF THE REMOTE HOOTING AND YELPING OF THE MACHINES OF ONE OF THE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICES
2893-139322-0040 THEN A WOMAN WITH A FACE OF MUTE WHITE TERROR AND ANOTHER WHO GASPED AND SHRIEKED AS SHE RAN WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW SAID GRAHAM PUZZLED FOR HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR THICK SPEECH THEN HE HEARD IT IN ENGLISH AND PERCEIVED THAT THE THING THAT EVERYONE WAS SHOUTING
2893-139322-0041 THAT MEN YELLED TO ONE ANOTHER THAT WOMEN TOOK UP SCREAMING THAT WAS PASSING LIKE THE FIRST BREEZE OF A THUNDERSTORM CHILL AND SUDDEN THROUGH THE CITY WAS THIS OSTROG HAS ORDERED THE BLACK POLICE TO LONDON THE BLACK POLICE ARE COMING FROM SOUTH AFRICA THE BLACK POLICE THE BLACK POLICE
2893-139322-0042 HE HESITATED LOOKED AT GRAHAM'S FACE AND TOLD HIM THE THING HE ALREADY KNEW BUT HOW CAN THEY KNOW ASKED ASANO GRAHAM HEARD SOMEONE SHOUTING STOP ALL WORK STOP ALL WORK
2893-139322-0043 AND A SWARTHY HUNCHBACK RIDICULOUSLY GAY IN GREEN AND GOLD CAME LEAPING DOWN THE PLATFORMS TOWARD HIM BAWLING AGAIN AND AGAIN IN GOOD ENGLISH THIS IS OSTROG'S DOING OSTROG THE KNAVE THE MASTER IS BETRAYED HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE
2893-139322-0044 HE YELLED AN UNSPEAKABLE HORROR THAT THE BLACK POLICE HAD DONE IN PARIS AND SO PASSED SHRIEKING OSTROG THE KNAVE FOR A MOMENT GRAHAM STOOD STILL FOR IT HAD COME UPON HIM AGAIN THAT THESE THINGS WERE A DREAM
2893-139322-0045 HE LOOKED UP AT THE GREAT CLIFF OF BUILDINGS ON EITHER SIDE VANISHING INTO BLUE HAZE AT LAST ABOVE THE LIGHTS AND DOWN TO THE ROARING TIERS OF PLATFORMS AND THE SHOUTING RUNNING PEOPLE WHO WERE GESTICULATING PAST
2893-139322-0046 THE MASTER IS BETRAYED THEY CRIED THE MASTER IS BETRAYED SUDDENLY THE SITUATION SHAPED ITSELF IN HIS MIND REAL AND URGENT
2893-139322-0047 HE SAID I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THE HOUR HAS COME HE THOUGHT SWIFTLY WHAT AM I TO DO GO BACK TO THE COUNCIL HOUSE SAID ASANO WHY SHOULD I NOT APPEAL THE PEOPLE ARE HERE
2893-139322-0048 YOU WILL LOSE TIME THEY WILL DOUBT IF IT IS YOU BUT THEY WILL MASS ABOUT THE COUNCIL HOUSE THERE YOU WILL FIND THEIR LEADERS YOUR STRENGTH IS THERE WITH THEM SUPPOSE THIS IS ONLY A RUMOUR
2893-139322-0049 IT SOUNDS TRUE SAID ASANO LET US HAVE THE FACTS SAID GRAHAM
2893-139322-0050 EVEN NOW THE RUINS MAY BE IMPASSABLE GRAHAM REGARDED HIM DOUBTFULLY AND FOLLOWED HIM THEY WENT UP THE STEPPED PLATFORMS TO THE SWIFTEST ONE AND THERE ASANO ACCOSTED A LABOURER THE ANSWERS TO HIS QUESTIONS WERE IN THE THICK VULGAR SPEECH WHAT DID HE SAY ASKED GRAHAM
2893-139322-0051 HAD NOT SOMEONE IN THE WIND VANE OFFICES LEARNT HE SAID A GIRL A GIRL NOT HE SAID A GIRL HE DID NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS WHO CAME OUT FROM THE COUNCIL HOUSE CRYING ALOUD AND TOLD THE MEN AT WORK AMONG THE RUINS
2893-139322-0052 AND THEN ANOTHER THING WAS SHOUTED SOMETHING THAT TURNED AN AIMLESS TUMULT INTO DETERMINATE MOVEMENTS IT CAME LIKE A WIND ALONG THE STREET
2910-131096-0000 A CERTAIN KING AND QUEEN HAD THREE DAUGHTERS THE CHARMS OF THE TWO ELDER WERE MORE THAN COMMON BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNGEST WAS SO WONDERFUL THAT THE POVERTY OF LANGUAGE IS UNABLE TO EXPRESS ITS DUE PRAISE THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY WAS SO GREAT
2910-131096-0001 THAT STRANGERS FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES CAME IN CROWDS TO ENJOY THE SIGHT AND LOOKED ON HER WITH AMAZEMENT PAYING HER THAT HOMAGE WHICH IS DUE ONLY TO VENUS HERSELF IN FACT VENUS FOUND HER ALTARS DESERTED
2910-131096-0002 WHILE MEN TURNED THEIR DEVOTION TO THIS YOUNG VIRGIN AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE PEOPLE SANG HER PRAISES AND STREWED HER WAY WITH CHAPLETS AND FLOWERS THIS PERVERSION OF HOMAGE DUE ONLY TO THE IMMORTAL POWERS TO THE EXALTATION OF A MORTAL
2910-131096-0003 GAVE GREAT OFFENCE TO THE REAL VENUS SHAKING HER AMBROSIAL LOCKS WITH INDIGNATION SHE EXCLAIMED AM I THEN TO BE ECLIPSED IN MY HONORS BY A MORTAL GIRL IN VAIN THEN DID THAT ROYAL SHEPHERD WHOSE JUDGMENT WAS APPROVED BY JOVE HIMSELF
2910-131096-0004 GIVE ME THE PALM OF BEAUTY OVER MY ILLUSTRIOUS RIVALS PALLAS AND JUNO BUT SHE SHALL NOT SO QUIETLY USURP MY HONORS I WILL GIVE HER CAUSE TO REPENT OF SO UNLAWFUL A BEAUTY
2910-131096-0005 MISCHIEVOUS ENOUGH IN HIS OWN NATURE AND ROUSES AND PROVOKES HIM YET MORE BY HER COMPLAINTS SHE POINTS OUT PSYCHE TO HIM AND SAYS MY DEAR SON PUNISH THAT CONTUMACIOUS BEAUTY GIVE THY MOTHER A REVENGE AS SWEET AS HER INJURIES ARE GREAT
2910-131096-0006 INFUSE INTO THE BOSOM OF THAT HAUGHTY GIRL A PASSION FOR SOME LOW MEAN UNWORTHY BEING SO THAT SHE MAY REAP A MORTIFICATION AS GREAT AS HER PRESENT EXULTATION AND TRIUMPH CUPID PREPARED TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF HIS MOTHER
2910-131096-0007 THERE ARE TWO FOUNTAINS IN VENUS'S GARDEN ONE OF SWEET WATERS THE OTHER OF BITTER CUPID FILLED TWO AMBER VASES ONE FROM EACH FOUNTAIN AND SUSPENDING THEM FROM THE TOP OF HIS QUIVER HASTENED TO THE CHAMBER OF PSYCHE WHOM HE FOUND ASLEEP
2910-131096-0008 HE SHED A FEW DROPS FROM THE BITTER FOUNTAIN OVER HER LIPS THOUGH THE SIGHT OF HER ALMOST MOVED HIM TO PITY THEN TOUCHED HER SIDE WITH THE POINT OF HIS ARROW AT THE TOUCH SHE AWOKE AND OPENED EYES UPON CUPID HIMSELF INVISIBLE
2910-131096-0009 WHICH SO STARTLED HIM THAT IN HIS CONFUSION HE WOUNDED HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN ARROW HEEDLESS OF HIS WOUND HIS WHOLE THOUGHT NOW WAS TO REPAIR THE MISCHIEF HE HAD DONE AND HE POURED THE BALMY DROPS OF JOY OVER ALL HER SILKEN RINGLETS
2910-131096-0010 PSYCHE HENCEFORTH FROWNED UPON BY VENUS DERIVED NO BENEFIT FROM ALL HER CHARMS TRUE ALL EYES WERE CAST EAGERLY UPON HER AND EVERY MOUTH SPOKE HER PRAISES
2910-131096-0011 HER TWO ELDER SISTERS OF MODERATE CHARMS HAD NOW LONG BEEN MARRIED TO TWO ROYAL PRINCES BUT PSYCHE IN HER LONELY APARTMENT DEPLORED HER SOLITUDE SICK OF THAT BEAUTY WHICH WHILE IT PROCURED ABUNDANCE OF FLATTERY HAD FAILED TO AWAKEN LOVE
2910-131096-0012 CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF APOLLO AND RECEIVED THIS ANSWER THE VIRGIN IS DESTINED FOR THE BRIDE OF NO MORTAL LOVER HER FUTURE HUSBAND AWAITS HER ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN HE IS A MONSTER WHOM NEITHER GODS NOR MEN CAN RESIST
2910-131096-0013 THIS DREADFUL DECREE OF THE ORACLE FILLED ALL THE PEOPLE WITH DISMAY AND HER PARENTS ABANDONED THEMSELVES TO GRIEF BUT PSYCHE SAID WHY MY DEAR PARENTS DO YOU NOW LAMENT ME
2910-131096-0014 YOU SHOULD RATHER HAVE GRIEVED WHEN THE PEOPLE SHOWERED UPON ME UNDESERVED HONORS AND WITH ONE VOICE CALLED ME A VENUS I NOW PERCEIVE THAT I AM A VICTIM TO THAT NAME I SUBMIT LEAD ME TO THAT ROCK TO WHICH MY UNHAPPY FATE HAS DESTINED ME
2910-131096-0015 ACCORDINGLY ALL THINGS BEING PREPARED THE ROYAL MAID TOOK HER PLACE IN THE PROCESSION WHICH MORE RESEMBLED A FUNERAL THAN A NUPTIAL POMP AND WITH HER PARENTS AMID THE LAMENTATIONS OF THE PEOPLE ASCENDED THE MOUNTAIN
2910-131096-0016 ON THE SUMMIT OF WHICH THEY LEFT HER ALONE AND WITH SORROWFUL HEARTS RETURNED HOME WHILE PSYCHE STOOD ON THE RIDGE OF THE MOUNTAIN PANTING WITH FEAR AND WITH EYES FULL OF TEARS THE GENTLE ZEPHYR RAISED HER FROM THE EARTH
2910-131096-0017 AND BORE HER WITH AN EASY MOTION INTO A FLOWERY DALE BY DEGREES HER MIND BECAME COMPOSED AND SHE LAID HERSELF DOWN ON THE GRASSY BANK TO SLEEP WHEN SHE AWOKE
2910-131096-0018 SHE ENTERED IT AND IN THE MIDST DISCOVERED A FOUNTAIN SENDING FORTH CLEAR AND CRYSTAL WATERS AND FAST BY A MAGNIFICENT PALACE WHOSE AUGUST FRONT IMPRESSED THE SPECTATOR THAT IT WAS NOT THE WORK OF MORTAL HANDS
2910-131096-0019 BUT THE HAPPY RETREAT OF SOME GOD DRAWN BY ADMIRATION AND WONDER SHE APPROACHED THE BUILDING AND VENTURED TO ENTER EVERY OBJECT SHE MET FILLED HER WITH PLEASURE AND AMAZEMENT GOLDEN PILLARS SUPPORTED THE VAULTED ROOF
2910-131096-0020 AND THE WALLS WERE ENRICHED WITH CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS REPRESENTING BEASTS OF THE CHASE AND RURAL SCENES ADAPTED TO DELIGHT THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER PROCEEDING ONWARD SHE PERCEIVED THAT BESIDES THE APARTMENTS OF STATE
2910-131096-0021 THERE WERE OTHERS FILLED WITH ALL MANNER OF TREASURES AND BEAUTIFUL AND PRECIOUS PRODUCTIONS OF NATURE AND ART WHILE HER EYES WERE THUS OCCUPIED A VOICE ADDRESSED HER THOUGH SHE SAW NO ONE UTTERING THESE WORDS SOVEREIGN LADY
2910-131096-0022 RETIRE THEREFORE TO YOUR CHAMBER AND REPOSE ON YOUR BED OF DOWN AND WHEN YOU SEE FIT REPAIR TO THE BATH SUPPER AWAITS YOU IN THE ADJOINING ALCOVE WHEN IT PLEASES YOU TO TAKE YOUR SEAT THERE PSYCHE GAVE EAR TO THE ADMONITIONS OF HER VOCAL ATTENDANTS
2910-131096-0023 AND AFTER REPOSE AND THE REFRESHMENT OF THE BATH SEATED HERSELF IN THE ALCOVE WHERE A TABLE IMMEDIATELY PRESENTED ITSELF WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE AID FROM WAITERS OR SERVANTS AND COVERED WITH THE GREATEST DELICACIES OF FOOD AND THE MOST NECTAREOUS WINES
2910-131096-0024 HER EARS TOO WERE FEASTED WITH MUSIC FROM INVISIBLE PERFORMERS OF WHOM ONE SANG ANOTHER PLAYED ON THE LUTE AND ALL CLOSED IN THE WONDERFUL HARMONY OF A FULL CHORUS SHE HAD NOT YET SEEN HER DESTINED HUSBAND
2910-131096-0025 BUT HIS ACCENTS WERE FULL OF LOVE AND INSPIRED A LIKE PASSION IN HER SHE OFTEN BEGGED HIM TO STAY AND LET HER BEHOLD HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT CONSENT ON THE CONTRARY HE CHARGED HER TO MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE HIM
2910-131096-0026 FOR IT WAS HIS PLEASURE FOR THE BEST OF REASONS TO KEEP CONCEALED WHY SHOULD YOU WISH TO BEHOLD ME HE SAID HAVE YOU ANY DOUBT OF MY LOVE HAVE YOU ANY WISH UNGRATIFIED IF YOU SAW ME PERHAPS YOU WOULD FEAR ME PERHAPS ADORE ME
2910-131096-0027 BUT ALL I ASK OF YOU IS TO LOVE ME I WOULD RATHER YOU WOULD LOVE ME AS AN EQUAL THAN ADORE ME AS A GOD THIS REASONING SOMEWHAT QUIETED PSYCHE FOR A TIME AND WHILE THE NOVELTY LASTED SHE FELT QUITE HAPPY
2910-131096-0028 BUT AT LENGTH THE THOUGHT OF HER PARENTS LEFT IN IGNORANCE OF HER FATE
2910-131096-0029 PREYED ON HER MIND AND MADE HER BEGIN TO FEEL HER PALACE AS BUT A SPLENDID PRISON WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME ONE NIGHT SHE TOLD HIM HER DISTRESS AND AT LAST DREW FROM HIM AN UNWILLING CONSENT THAT HER SISTERS SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO SEE HER
2910-131096-0030 SO CALLING ZEPHYR SHE ACQUAINTED HIM WITH HER HUSBAND'S COMMANDS AND HE PROMPTLY OBEDIENT SOON BROUGHT THEM ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO THEIR SISTER'S VALLEY THEY EMBRACED HER AND SHE RETURNED THEIR CARESSES COME SAID PSYCHE
2910-131096-0031 ENTER WITH ME MY HOUSE AND REFRESH YOURSELVES WITH WHATEVER YOUR SISTER HAS TO OFFER THEN TAKING THEIR HANDS SHE LED THEM INTO HER GOLDEN PALACE AND COMMITTED THEM TO THE CARE OF HER NUMEROUS TRAIN OF ATTENDANT VOICES TO REFRESH THEM IN HER BATHS
2910-131096-0032 AND AT HER TABLE AND TO SHOW THEM ALL HER TREASURES THE VIEW OF THESE CELESTIAL DELIGHTS CAUSED ENVY TO ENTER THEIR BOSOMS AT SEEING THEIR YOUNG SISTER POSSESSED OF SUCH STATE AND SPLENDOR SO MUCH EXCEEDING THEIR OWN
2910-131096-0033 THEY ASKED HER NUMBERLESS QUESTIONS AMONG OTHERS WHAT SORT OF A PERSON HER HUSBAND WAS PSYCHE REPLIED THAT HE WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WHO GENERALLY SPENT THE DAYTIME IN HUNTING UPON THE MOUNTAINS THE SISTERS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY
2910-131096-0034 SOON MADE HER CONFESS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO FILL HER BOSOM WITH DARK SUSPICIONS CALL TO MIND THEY SAID
2910-131096-0035 THE INHABITANTS OF THIS VALLEY SAY THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS A TERRIBLE AND MONSTROUS SERPENT WHO NOURISHES YOU FOR A WHILE WITH DAINTIES THAT HE MAY BY AND BY DEVOUR YOU TAKE OUR ADVICE PROVIDE YOURSELF WITH A LAMP AND A SHARP KNIFE
2910-131096-0036 PUT THEM IN CONCEALMENT THAT YOUR HUSBAND MAY NOT DISCOVER THEM AND WHEN HE IS SOUND ASLEEP SLIP OUT OF BED BRING FORTH YOUR LAMP AND SEE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER WHAT THEY SAY IS TRUE OR NOT IF IT IS HESITATE NOT TO CUT OFF THE MONSTER'S HEAD AND THEREBY RECOVER YOUR LIBERTY
2910-131096-0037 PSYCHE RESISTED THESE PERSUASIONS AS WELL AS SHE COULD BUT THEY DID NOT FAIL TO HAVE THEIR EFFECT ON HER MIND AND WHEN HER SISTERS WERE GONE THEIR WORDS AND HER OWN CURIOSITY WERE TOO STRONG FOR HER TO RESIST SO SHE PREPARED HER LAMP
2910-131096-0038 AND A SHARP KNIFE AND HID THEM OUT OF SIGHT OF HER HUSBAND WHEN HE HAD FALLEN INTO HIS FIRST SLEEP SHE SILENTLY ROSE AND UNCOVERING HER LAMP BEHELD NOT A HIDEOUS MONSTER BUT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND CHARMING OF THE GODS
2910-131096-0039 WITH TWO DEWY WINGS ON HIS SHOULDERS WHITER THAN SNOW AND WITH SHINING FEATHERS LIKE THE TENDER BLOSSOMS OF SPRING AS SHE LEANED THE LAMP OVER TO HAVE A NEARER VIEW OF HIS FACE A DROP OF BURNING OIL FELL ON THE SHOULDER OF THE GOD
2910-131096-0040 STARTLED WITH WHICH HE OPENED HIS EYES AND FIXED THEM FULL UPON HER THEN WITHOUT SAYING ONE WORD HE SPREAD HIS WHITE WINGS AND FLEW OUT OF THE WINDOW PSYCHE IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO FOLLOW HIM FELL FROM THE WINDOW TO THE GROUND
2910-131096-0041 CUPID BEHOLDING HER AS SHE LAY IN THE DUST STOPPED HIS FLIGHT FOR AN INSTANT AND SAID O FOOLISH PSYCHE IS IT THUS YOU REPAY MY LOVE AFTER HAVING DISOBEYED MY MOTHER'S COMMANDS AND MADE YOU MY WIFE WILL YOU THINK ME A MONSTER AND CUT OFF MY HEAD
2910-131096-0042 BUT GO RETURN TO YOUR SISTERS WHOSE ADVICE YOU SEEM TO THINK PREFERABLE TO MINE I INFLICT NO OTHER PUNISHMENT ON YOU THAN TO LEAVE YOU FOREVER LOVE CANNOT DWELL WITH SUSPICION SO SAYING HE FLED AWAY LEAVING POOR PSYCHE PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND
2910-131096-0043 FILLING THE PLACE WITH MOURNFUL LAMENTATIONS WHEN SHE HAD RECOVERED SOME DEGREE OF COMPOSURE SHE LOOKED AROUND HER BUT THE PALACE AND GARDENS HAD VANISHED AND SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE OPEN FIELD NOT FAR FROM THE CITY WHERE HER SISTERS DWELT
2910-131096-0044 PSYCHE MEANWHILE WANDERED DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT FOOD OR REPOSE IN SEARCH OF HER HUSBAND CASTING HER EYES ON A LOFTY MOUNTAIN HAVING ON ITS BROW A MAGNIFICENT TEMPLE SHE SIGHED AND SAID TO HERSELF PERHAPS MY LOVE MY LORD INHABITS THERE
2910-131096-0045 AND DIRECTED HER STEPS THITHER SHE HAD NO SOONER ENTERED THAN SHE SAW HEAPS OF CORN SOME IN LOOSE EARS AND SOME IN SHEAVES WITH MINGLED EARS OF BARLEY
2910-131096-0046 SCATTERED ABOUT LAY SICKLES AND RAKES AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF HARVEST WITHOUT ORDER AS IF THROWN CARELESSLY OUT OF THE WEARY REAPERS HANDS IN THE SULTRY HOURS OF THE DAY THIS UNSEEMLY CONFUSION
2910-131096-0047 BY SEPARATING AND SORTING EVERYTHING TO ITS PROPER PLACE AND KIND

2910-131096-0049 YET I CAN TEACH YOU HOW BEST TO ALLAY HER DISPLEASURE GO THEN AND VOLUNTARILY SURRENDER YOURSELF TO YOUR LADY AND SOVEREIGN AND TRY BY MODESTY AND SUBMISSION TO WIN HER FORGIVENESS AND PERHAPS HER FAVOR WILL RESTORE YOU THE HUSBAND YOU HAVE LOST
2910-131096-0050 PSYCHE OBEYED THE COMMANDS OF CERES AND TOOK HER WAY TO THE TEMPLE OF VENUS ENDEAVORING TO FORTIFY HER MIND AND RUMINATING ON WHAT SHE SHOULD SAY AND HOW BEST PROPITIATE THE ANGRY GODDESS FEELING THAT THE ISSUE WAS DOUBTFUL AND PERHAPS FATAL
2910-131096-0051 MOST UNDUTIFUL AND FAITHLESS OF SERVANTS SAID SHE DO YOU AT LAST REMEMBER THAT YOU REALLY HAVE A MISTRESS OR HAVE YOU RATHER COME TO SEE YOUR SICK HUSBAND YET LAID UP OF THE WOUND GIVEN HIM BY HIS LOVING WIFE YOU ARE SO ILL FAVORED AND DISAGREEABLE
2910-131096-0052 THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN MERIT YOUR LOVER MUST BE BY DINT OF INDUSTRY AND DILIGENCE I WILL MAKE TRIAL OF YOUR HOUSEWIFERY THEN SHE ORDERED PSYCHE TO BE LED TO THE STOREHOUSE OF HER TEMPLE
2910-131096-0053 WHERE WAS LAID UP A GREAT QUANTITY OF WHEAT BARLEY MILLET VETCHES BEANS AND LENTILS PREPARED FOR FOOD FOR HER PIGEONS AND SAID TAKE AND SEPARATE ALL THESE GRAINS PUTTING ALL OF THE SAME KIND IN A PARCEL BY THEMSELVES
2910-131096-0054 AND SEE THAT YOU GET IT DONE BEFORE EVENING THEN VENUS DEPARTED AND LEFT HER TO HER TASK BUT PSYCHE IN A PERFECT CONSTERNATION AT THE ENORMOUS WORK SAT STUPID AND SILENT WITHOUT MOVING A FINGER TO THE INEXTRICABLE HEAP
2910-131096-0055 WHILE SHE SAT DESPAIRING CUPID STIRRED UP THE LITTLE ANT A NATIVE OF THE FIELDS TO TAKE COMPASSION ON HER THE LEADER OF THE ANT HILL FOLLOWED BY WHOLE HOSTS OF HIS SIX LEGGED SUBJECTS
2910-131096-0056 APPROACHED THE HEAP AND WITH THE UTMOST DILIGENCE TAKING GRAIN BY GRAIN THEY SEPARATED THE PILE SORTING EACH KIND TO ITS PARCEL AND WHEN IT WAS ALL DONE THEY VANISHED OUT OF SIGHT IN A MOMENT
2910-131096-0057 VENUS AT THE APPROACH OF TWILIGHT RETURNED FROM THE BANQUET OF THE GODS BREATHING ODORS AND CROWNED WITH ROSES SEEING THE TASK DONE SHE EXCLAIMED THIS IS NO WORK OF YOURS WICKED ONE
2910-131096-0058 SO SAYING SHE THREW HER A PIECE OF BLACK BREAD FOR HER SUPPER AND WENT AWAY NEXT MORNING VENUS ORDERED PSYCHE TO BE CALLED AND SAID TO HER BEHOLD YONDER GROVE WHICH STRETCHES ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE WATER
2910-131096-0059 THERE YOU WILL FIND SHEEP FEEDING WITHOUT A SHEPHERD WITH GOLDEN SHINING FLEECES ON THEIR BACKS GO FETCH ME A SAMPLE OF THAT PRECIOUS WOOL GATHERED FROM EVERY ONE OF THEIR FLEECES
2910-131096-0060 PSYCHE OBEDIENTLY WENT TO THE RIVERSIDE PREPARED TO DO HER BEST TO EXECUTE THE COMMAND BUT THE RIVER GOD INSPIRED THE REEDS WITH HARMONIOUS MURMURS WHICH SEEMED TO SAY O MAIDEN SEVERELY TRIED TEMPT NOT THE DANGEROUS FLOOD
2910-131096-0061 NOR VENTURE AMONG THE FORMIDABLE RAMS ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR AS LONG AS THEY ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE RISING SUN THEY BURN WITH A CRUEL RAGE TO DESTROY MORTALS WITH THEIR SHARP HORNS OR RUDE TEETH BUT WHEN THE NOONTIDE SUN HAS DRIVEN THE CATTLE TO THE SHADE
2910-131096-0062 AND THE SERENE SPIRIT OF THE FLOOD HAS LULLED THEM TO REST YOU MAY THEN CROSS IN SAFETY AND YOU WILL FIND THE WOOLLY GOLD STICKING TO THE BUSHES AND THE TRUNKS OF THE TREES THUS THE COMPASSIONATE RIVER GOD GAVE PSYCHE INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO ACCOMPLISH HER TASK
2910-131096-0063 AND BY OBSERVING HIS DIRECTIONS SHE SOON RETURNED TO VENUS WITH HER ARMS FULL OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE BUT SHE RECEIVED NOT THE APPROBATION OF HER IMPLACABLE MISTRESS WHO SAID I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS BY NONE OF YOUR OWN DOINGS THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS TASK
2910-131096-0064 AND I AM NOT SATISFIED YET THAT YOU HAVE ANY CAPACITY TO MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL BUT I HAVE ANOTHER TASK FOR YOU HERE TAKE THIS BOX AND GO YOUR WAY TO THE INFERNAL SHADES AND GIVE THIS BOX TO PROSERPINE

2910-131096-0066 PSYCHE WAS NOW SATISFIED THAT HER DESTRUCTION WAS AT HAND BEING OBLIGED TO GO WITH HER OWN FEET DIRECTLY DOWN TO EREBUS WHEREFORE TO MAKE NO DELAY OF WHAT WAS NOT TO BE AVOIDED
2910-131096-0067 SHE GOES TO THE TOP OF A HIGH TOWER TO PRECIPITATE HERSELF HEADLONG THUS TO DESCEND THE SHORTEST WAY TO THE SHADES BELOW BUT A VOICE FROM THE TOWER SAID TO HER WHY POOR UNLUCKY GIRL DOST THOU DESIGN TO PUT AN END TO THY DAYS IN SO DREADFUL A MANNER
2910-131096-0068 AND WHAT COWARDICE MAKES THEE SINK UNDER THIS LAST DANGER WHO HAST BEEN SO MIRACULOUSLY SUPPORTED IN ALL THY FORMER THEN THE VOICE TOLD HER HOW BY A CERTAIN CAVE SHE MIGHT REACH THE REALMS OF PLUTO AND HOW TO AVOID ALL THE DANGERS OF THE ROAD
