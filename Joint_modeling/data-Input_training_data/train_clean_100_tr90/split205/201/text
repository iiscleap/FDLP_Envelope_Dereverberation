8088-284756-0041 WEBBED I ASKED STARTLED WEBBED NODDED MERCER SOLEMNLY AS ARE HER FEET BUT LISTEN TAYLOR I WAS AMAZED AND NOT A LITTLE RATTLED WHEN SHE CAME FOR ME
8088-284756-0042 I RAN THROUGH THE FRENCH WINDOWS OUT INTO THE PATIO FOR A MOMENT SHE RAN AFTER ME RATHER AWKWARDLY AND HEAVILY BUT SWIFTLY NEVERTHELESS THEN SHE SAW THE POOL APPARENTLY FORGETTING THAT I EXISTED SHE LEAPED INTO THE WATER
8088-284756-0043 I REMINDED HIM AS HE PAUSED APPARENTLY LOST IN THOUGHT I TRIED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HER I PUT ON MY BATHING SUIT AND DIVED INTO THE POOL WELL SHE CAME AT ME LIKE A SHARK QUICK AS A FLASH HER TEETH SHOWING HER HANDS TEARING LIKE CLAWS THROUGH THE WATER
8088-284756-0044 SHE MANAGED TO CLAW ME JUST ONCE MERCER RESUMED WRAPPING THE ROBE ABOUT HIM AGAIN THEN I GOT OUT AND CALLED ON CARSON FOR HELP I PUT HIM INTO A BATHING SUIT AND WE BOTH ENDEAVORED TO CORNER HER
8088-284756-0045 CARSON GOT TWO BAD SCRATCHES AND ONE RATHER SERIOUS BITE THAT I HAVE BANDAGED I HAVE A NUMBER OF LACERATIONS BUT I DIDN'T FARE SO BADLY AS CARSON BECAUSE I AM FASTER IN THE WATER THAN HE IS THE HARDER WE TRIED THE MORE DETERMINED I BECAME
8088-284756-0046 WE MOVED OUT OF THE ROOM NOTHING HUMAN CAN LIVE UNDER WATER AND BREATHE WATER AS SHE DOES MERCER PAUSED A MOMENT STARING AT ME ODDLY THE HUMAN RACE HE SAID GRAVELY CAME UP OUT OF SEA THE HUMAN RACE AS WE KNOW IT SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK
8088-284756-0047 MERCER SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK I DON'T GET IT MERCER SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT MADE NO OTHER REPLY UNTIL WE STOOD AGAIN ON THE EDGE OF THE POOL THE GIRL WAS STANDING WHERE WE HAD LEFT HER AND AS SHE LOOKED UP INTO MY FACE SHE SMILED AGAIN
8088-284756-0048 AND IN THAT WHITE BATHING SUIT YES I BELIEVE SHE'S TAKEN A FANCY TO YOU MERCER'S EYES WERE DANCING IF SHE HAS HE WENT ON IT'LL MAKE OUR WORK VERY EASY WHAT WORK I ASKED SUSPICIOUSLY
8088-284756-0049 I THINK I HAVE WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH PERFECTED EXPERIMENTALLY HE EXPLAINED RAPIDLY I FELL ASLEEP WORKING ON IT AT THREE O'CLOCK OR THEREABOUTS THIS MORNING AND SOME TESTS WITH CARSON SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IT IS A SUCCESS
8088-284756-0050 I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU TO MORROW FOR FURTHER TEST NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF DAMNED HARD WORK TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TAYLOR
8088-284756-0051 I ASKED EAGERLY GLANCING DOWN AT THE BEAUTIFUL PALE FACE THAT GLIMMERED UP AT ME THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER OF THE POOL WHY TRY IT ON HER EXCLAIMED MERCER WITH MOUNTING ENTHUSIASM DON'T YOU SEE TAYLOR
8088-284756-0052 IF IT WILL WORK ON HER AND WE CAN DIRECT HER THOUGHTS WE CAN FIND OUT HER HISTORY THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE WE'LL ADD A PAGE TO SCIENTIFIC HISTORY A WHOLE BIG CHAPTER THAT WILL MAKE US FAMOUS MAN THIS IS SO BIG IT'S SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET
8088-284756-0053 LOOK AND HE HELD OUT A THIN ARISTOCRATIC BROWN HAND BEFORE MY EYES A HAND THAT SHOOK WITH NERVOUS EXCITEMENT I DON'T BLAME YOU I SAID QUICKLY
8088-284756-0054 LET'S GET BUSY WHAT CAN I DO MERCER REACHED AROUND THE DOOR INTO THE LABORATORY AND PRESSED A BUTTON FOR CARSON HE EXPLAINED WE'LL NEED HIS HELP IN THE MEANTIME WE'LL LOOK OVER THE SET UP THE APPARATUS IS STREWN ALL OVER THE PLACE
8088-284756-0055 HE HAD NOT EXAGGERATED THE SET UP CONSISTED OF A WHOLE BANK OF TUBES EACH ONE IN ITS OWN SHIELDING COPPER BOX ON A MUCH DRILLED HORIZONTAL PANEL PROPPED UP ON INSULATORS WERE HALF A SCORE OF DELICATE METERS OF ONE KIND AND ANOTHER
8088-284756-0056 WITH THIN BLACK FINGERS THAT PULSED AND TREMBLED BEHIND THE PANEL WAS A TALL CYLINDER WOUND WITH SHINING COPPER WIRE AND BESIDE IT ANOTHER PANEL UPRIGHT FAIRLY BRISTLING WITH KNOBS CONTACT POINTS POTENTIOMETERS RHEOSTATS AND SWITCHES
8088-284756-0057 AND IN THE CENTER A SWITCH WITH FOUR CONTACT POINTS A HEAVY SNAKY CABLE LED FROM THIS PANEL TO THE MAZE OF APPARATUS FURTHER ON THIS IS THE CONTROL PANEL EXPLAINED MERCER THE WHOLE AFFAIR YOU UNDERSTAND IS IN LABORATORY FORM
8088-284756-0058 NOTHING ASSEMBLED PUT THE DIFFERENT ANTENNAE PLUG INTO THESE JACKS LIKE THIS HE PICKED UP A WEIRD HASTILY BUILT CONTRIVANCE COMPOSED OF TWO SEMI CIRCULAR PIECES OF SPRING BRASS CROSSED AT RIGHT ANGLES
8088-284756-0059 ON ALL FOUR ENDS WERE BRIGHT SILVERY ELECTRODES THREE OF THEM CIRCULAR IN SHAPE ONE OF THEM ELONGATED AND SLIGHTLY CURVED WITH A QUICK NERVOUS GESTURE MERCER FITTED THE THING TO HIS HEAD
8088-284756-0060 SO THAT THE ELONGATED ELECTRODE PRESSED AGAINST THE BACK OF HIS NECK EXTENDING A FEW INCHES DOWN HIS SPINE THE OTHER THREE CIRCULAR ELECTRODES RESTED ON HIS FOREHEAD AND EITHER SIDE OF HIS HEAD
8088-284756-0061 SOME TEN FEET IN LENGTH ENDING IN A SIMPLE SWITCHBOARD PLUG WHICH MERCER FITTED INTO THE UPPERMOST OF THE THREE JACKS NOW HE DIRECTED YOU PUT ON THIS ONE
8088-284756-0062 HE ADJUSTED A SECOND CONTRIVANCE UPON MY HEAD SMILING AS I SHRANK FROM THE CONTACT OF THE COLD METAL ON MY SKIN AND THINK HE MOVED THE SWITCH FROM THE POSITION MARKED OFF TO THE SECOND CONTACT POINT WATCHING ME INTENTLY HIS DARK EYES GLEAMING
8088-284756-0063 VERY NICE OLD CHAP CARSON IMPRESSIVE EVEN IN HIS BATHING SUIT MERCER WAS MIGHTY LUCKY TO HAVE A MAN LIKE CARSON SOMETHING SEEMED TO TICK SUDDENLY SOMEWHERE DEEP IN MY CONSCIOUSNESS YES THAT'S VERY TRUE
8088-284756-0064 THE WORDS WERE NOT SPOKEN I DID NOT HEAR THEM I KNEW THEM WHAT I GLANCED AT MERCER AND HE LAUGHED ALOUD WITH PLEASURE AND EXCITEMENT IT WORKED HE CRIED
8088-284756-0065 I RECEIVED YOUR THOUGHT REGARDING CARSON AND THEN TURNED THE SWITCH SO THAT YOU RECEIVED MY THOUGHT AND YOU DID RATHER GINGERLY I REMOVED THE THING FROM MY HEAD AND LAID IT ON THE TABLE IT'S WIZARDRY MERCER IF IT WILL WORK AS WELL ON HER IT WILL I KNOW IT WILL
8088-284756-0066 IF WE CAN GET HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE REPLIED MERCER CONFIDENTLY I HAVE ONLY THREE OF THEM I HAD PLANNED SOME THREE CORNERED EXPERIMENTS WITH YOU CARSON AND MYSELF WE'LL LEAVE CARSON OUT OF TO NIGHT'S EXPERIMENT HOWEVER FOR WE'LL NEED HIM TO OPERATE THIS SWITCH
8088-284756-0067 THE OTHER TWO RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON THE FIRST CONTACT NUMBER ONE SENDS AND NUMBERS TWO AND THREE RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON NUMBER TWO THEN HE SENDS THOUGHTS AND NUMBERS ONE AND THREE RECEIVE THEM AND SO ON
8088-284756-0068 I'LL LENGTHEN THESE LEADS SO THAT WE CAN RUN THEM OUT INTO THE POOL AND THEN WE'LL BE READY SOMEHOW WE MUST INDUCE HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE THINGS EVEN IF WE HAVE TO USE FORCE I'M SURE THE THREE OF US CAN HANDLE HER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO I SMILED
8088-284756-0069 SHE WAS SUCH A SLIM GRACEFUL ALMOST DELICATE LITTLE THING THE THOUGHT THAT THREE STRONG MEN MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL HER SEEMED ALMOST AMUSING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN ACTION YET SAID MERCER GRIMLY
8088-284756-0070 THEN WITH ALL THREE OF THE DEVICES HE CALLED ANTENNAE IN HIS HAND THEIR LEADS PLUGGED INTO THE CONTROL PANEL HE LED THE WAY TO THE SIDE OF THE POOL
8088-284756-0071 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN HER MOVE IN THIS FASHION SHE SEEMED TO PROPEL HERSELF WITH A SUDDEN MIGHTY THRUST OF HER FEET AGAINST THE BOTTOM SHE DARTED THROUGH THE WATER WITH THE SPEED OF AN ARROW YET STOPPED AS GENTLY AS THOUGH SHE HAD MERELY FLOATED THERE
8088-284756-0072 AS SHE LOOKED UP HER EYES UNMISTAKABLY SOUGHT MINE AND HER SMILE SEEMED WARM AND INVITING SHE MADE AGAIN THAT STRANGE LITTLE GESTURE OF INVITATION WITH AN EFFORT I GLANCED AT MERCER
8088-284756-0073 THERE WAS SOMETHING DEVILISHLY FASCINATING ABOUT THE GIRL'S GREAT DARK SEARCHING EYES I'M GOING IN I SAID HOARSELY
8088-284756-0074 I HEADED DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE HEAVY BRONZE LADDER THAT LED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I HAD TWO REASONS IN MIND I WOULD NEED SOMETHING TO KEEP ME UNDER WATER WITH MY LUNGS FULL OF AIR AND I COULD GET OUT QUICKLY IF IT WERE NECESSARY
8088-284756-0075 I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE LIVID JAGGED FURROWS IN MERCER'S SIDE QUICKLY AS I SHOT TO THE LADDER SHE WAS THERE BEFORE ME A DIM WAVERING WHITE SHAPE WAITING I PAUSED HOLDING TO A RUNG OF THE LADDER WITH ONE HAND
8088-284756-0076 SHE CAME CLOSER WALKING WITH THE AIRY GRACE I HAD NOTED BEFORE AND MY HEART POUNDED AGAINST MY RIBS AS SHE RAISED ONE LONG SLIM ARM TOWARDS ME
8088-284756-0077 PERHAPS I THOUGHT QUICKLY THIS WAS WITH HER A SIGN OF GREETING I LIFTED MY OWN ARM AND RETURNED THE SALUTATION IF SALUTATION IT WERE AWARE OF A STRANGE RISING AND FALLING SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUMMING IN MY EARS
8088-284756-0078 THE SOUND CEASED SUDDENLY ON A RISING NOTE AS THOUGH OF INQUIRY AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT I HAD HEARD THE SPEECH OF THIS STRANGE CREATURE BEFORE I COULD THINK OF A COURSE OF ACTION MY ACHING LUNGS REMINDED ME OF THE NEED OF AIR
8088-284756-0079 AND I RELEASED MY HOLD ON THE LADDER AND LET MY BODY RISE TO THE SURFACE
8088-284756-0080 I LOOKED DOWN THE GIRL WAS WATCHING ME AND THERE WAS NO SMILE ON HER FACE NOW
8088-284756-0081 AS HER FACE CAME CLOSE TO MY OWN I BECAME AWARE OF THE HUMMING CROONING SOUND I HAD HEARD BEFORE LOUDER THIS TIME
8088-284756-0082 I SMILED BACK AT HER AND SHOOK MY HEAD
8088-284756-0083 I POINTED UPWARD FOR I WAS FEELING THE NEED FOR FRESH AIR AGAIN AND SLOWLY MOUNTED THE LADDER THIS TIME SHE DID NOT GRASP ME BUT WATCHED ME INTENTLY AS THOUGH UNDERSTANDING WHAT I DID AND THE REASONS FOR IT
8088-284756-0084 BRING ONE OF YOUR GADGETS OVER HERE MERCER I CALLED ACROSS THE POOL I THINK I'M MAKING PROGRESS GOOD BOY HE CRIED AND CAME RUNNING WITH TWO OF THE ANTENNAE THE LONG INSULATED CORDS TRAILING BEHIND HIM THROUGH THE WATER THE GIRL WATCHED HIM EVIDENT DISLIKE IN HER EYES
8088-284756-0085 THE SALT WATER WOULD SHORT THE ANTENNAE YOU SEE TRY TO GET HER TO WEAR ONE AND THEN YOU GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF WATER AND DON YOURS AND REMEMBER SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US BY WORDS WE'LL HAVE TO GET HER TO CONVEY HER THOUGHTS BY MEANS OF MENTAL PICTURES
8088-284756-0086 I'LL TRY TO IMPRESS THAT ON HER UNDERSTAND I NODDED AND PICKED UP ONE OF THE INSTRUMENTS FIRE WHEN READY GRIDLEY I COMMENTED AND SANK AGAIN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I TOUCHED THE GIRL'S HEAD WITH ONE FINGER AND THEN POINTED TO MY OWN HEAD
8088-284756-0087 TRYING TO CONVEY TO HER THAT SHE COULD GET HER THOUGHTS TO ME THEN I HELD UP THE ANTENNAE AND PLACED IT ON MY OWN HEAD TO SHOW THAT IT COULD NOT HARM HER MY NEXT MOVE WAS TO OFFER HER THE INSTRUMENT MOVING SLOWLY AND SMILING REASSURINGLY
8088-284756-0088 NO MEAN FEAT UNDER WATER SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN HER EYES FIXED ON MINE
8088-284756-0089 I SMILED AND NODDED AND PRESSED HER SHOULDER IN TOKEN OF FRIENDLY GREETING THEN GESTURING TOWARD MY OWN HEAD AGAIN AND POINTING UPWARD I CLIMBED THE LADDER ALL RIGHT MERCER I SHOUTED START AT ONCE BEFORE SHE GROWS RESTLESS
8088-284756-0090 I'VE ALREADY STARTED HE CALLED BACK AND I HURRIEDLY DONNED MY OWN INSTRUMENT
8088-284756-0091 SO THAT MY HEAD REMAINED OUT OF WATER AND SMILED DOWN AT THE GIRL TOUCHING THE INSTRUMENT ON MY HEAD AND THEN POINTING TO HERS I COULD SENSE MERCER'S THOUGHTS NOW HE WAS PICTURING HIMSELF WALKING LONG THE SHORE WITH THE STORMY OCEAN IN THE BACKGROUND
8088-284756-0092 I SAW HIM RUN UP TO THE POOL AND LIFT THE SLIM PALE FIGURE IN HIS ARMS
8088-284756-0093 I VISUALIZED THEM JUST AS I COULD CLOSE MY EYES AND VISUALIZE FOR EXAMPLE THE FIREPLACE IN THE LIVING ROOM OF MY OWN HOME I LOOKED DOWN AT THE GIRL SHE WAS FROWNING AND HER EYES WERE VERY WIDE
8088-284756-0094 HER HEAD WAS A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE IN THE ATTITUDE OF ONE WHO LISTENS INTENTLY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY MERCER THOUGHT OUT THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS EXPERIENCES WITH THE GIRL UNTIL SHE HAD PLUNGED INTO THE POOL THEN I SAW AGAIN THE BEACH
8088-284756-0095 I WAS AWARE OF THE SOFT LITTLE TICK IN THE CENTER OF MY BRAIN THAT ANNOUNCED THAT THE SWITCH HAD BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER CONTACT POINT I GLANCED DOWN AT HER SHE WAS STARING UP AT ME WITH HER GREAT CURIOUS EYES
8088-284756-0096 AND I SENSED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE INSTRUMENT I WORE THAT SHE WAS THINKING OF ME I SAW MY OWN FEATURES IDEALIZED GLOWING WITH A STRANGE BEAUTY THAT WAS CERTAINLY NONE OF MY OWN I REALIZED THAT I SAW MYSELF IN SHORT AS SHE SAW ME
8088-284756-0097 A DIM BLUISH LIGHT FILTERED DOWN ON A SCENE SUCH AS MORTAL EYES HAVE NEVER SEEN ALL AROUND WERE STRANGE STRUCTURES OF JAGGED CORAL ROUGHLY CIRCULAR AS TO BASE AND ROUNDED ON TOP RESEMBLING VERY MUCH THE IGLOOS OF THE ESKIMOS
8088-284756-0098 THE STRUCTURES VARIED GREATLY IN SIZE AND SEEMED TO BE ARRANGED IN SOME SORT OF REGULAR ORDER LIKE HOUSES ALONG A NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0099 AROUND MANY OF THEM GREW CLUSTERS OF STRANGE AND COLORFUL SEAWEEDS THAT WAVED THEIR BANNERS GENTLY AS THOUGH SOME IMPERCEPTIBLE CURRENT DALLIED WITH THEM IN PASSING HERE AND THERE FIGURES MOVED SLIM WHITE FIGURES THAT STROLLED ALONG THE NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0100 OR AT TIMES SHOT OVERHEAD LIKE VERITABLE TORPEDOES THERE WERE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN MOVING THERE THE MEN WERE BROADER OF SHOULDER AND THEIR HAIR WHICH THEY WORE TO THEIR KNEES WAS SOMEWHAT DARKER IN COLOR THAN THAT OF THE WOMEN BOTH SEXES WERE SLIM
8088-284756-0101 AND THERE WAS A REMARKABLE UNIFORMITY OF SIZE AND APPEARANCE NONE OF THE STRANGE BEINGS WORE GARMENTS OF ANY KIND NOR WERE THEY NECESSARY
8088-284756-0102 THE CLINGING TRESSES WERE CINCTURED AT THE WAIST WITH A SORT OF CORD OF TWISTED ORANGE COLORED MATERIAL AND SOME OF THE YOUNGER WOMEN WORE BANDS OF THE SAME MATERIAL AROUND THEIR BROWS NEAREST OF ALL THE FIGURES WAS THE GIRL WHO WAS VISUALIZING ALL THIS FOR US
8088-284756-0103 SHE WAS WALKING SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE CLUSTER OF CORAL STRUCTURES ONCE OR TWICE SHE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO HOLD CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE BUT EACH TIME SHE MOVED ON THE CORAL STRUCTURES GREW SMALLER AND POORER
8088-284756-0104 FINALLY THE GIRL TROD ALONE ON THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN BETWEEN GREAT GROWTHS OF KELP AND SEAWEEDS WITH DIM LOOMING MASSES OF FAINTLY TINTED CORAL EVERYWHERE ONCE SHE PASSED CLOSE TO A TILTED RAGGED HULK OF SOME ANCIENT VESSEL
8088-284756-0105 ITS NAKED RIBS PACKED WITH DRIFTED SAND SAUNTERING DREAMILY SHE MOVED AWAY FROM THE ANCIENT DERELICT SUDDENLY A DIM SHADOW SWEPT ACROSS THE SAND AT HER FEET AND SHE ARROWED FROM THE SPOT LIKE A WHITE SLIM METEOR
8088-284756-0106 BUT BEHIND HER DARTED A BLACK AND SWIFTER SHADOW A SHARK LIKE A FLASH SHE TURNED AND FACED THE MONSTER SOMETHING SHE HAD DRAWN FROM HER GIRDLE SHONE PALELY IN HER HAND IT WAS A KNIFE OF WHETTED STONE OR BONE
8088-284756-0107 THE WHITE FIGURE OF THE GIRL SHOT ONWARD THROUGH THE SCARLET FLOOD BLINDED SHE DID NOT SEE THAT THE JUTTING RIBS OF THE ANCIENT SHIP WERE IN HER PATH I SEEMED TO SEE HER CRASH HEAD ON INTO ONE OF THE MASSIVE TIMBERS
8088-284756-0108 AND I CRIED OUT INVOLUNTARILY AND GLANCED DOWN AT THE GIRL IN THE WATER AT MY FEET HER EYES WERE GLOWING SHE KNEW THAT I HAD UNDERSTOOD HAZILY THEN I SEEMED TO VISUALIZE HER BODY FLOATING LIMPLY IN THE WATER IT WAS ALL VERY VAGUE AND INDISTINCT
8088-284756-0109 THE GIRL WAS THINKING OF HER SUFFERING TAKEN OUT OF HER NATIVE ELEMENT
8088-284756-0110 THAT NO DOUBT WAS WHY SHE HATED HIM
8088-284756-0111 ADJUSTED TO HER OWN IDEAS OF WHAT A MAN SHOULD BE I FLUNG THE INSTRUMENT FROM MY HEAD AND DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I GRIPPED BOTH HER SHOULDERS GENTLY TO EXPRESS MY THANKS AND FRIENDSHIP MY HEART WAS POUNDING
8088-284756-0112 THERE WAS A STRANGE FASCINATION ABOUT THIS GIRL FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA A SUBTLE APPEAL THAT WAS ANSWERED FROM SOME DEEP SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN OF MY BEING I FORGOT FOR THE MOMENT WHO AND WHAT I WAS
8088-284756-0113 HER GREAT WEIRDLY BLUE EYES SEEMED TO BORE INTO MY BRAIN I COULD FEEL THEM THROBBING THERE I FORGOT TIME AND SPACE I SAW ONLY THAT PALE SMILING FACE AND THOSE GREAT DARK EYES
8088-284756-0114 THEN STRANGLING I TORE MYSELF FROM HER EMBRACE AND SHOT TO THE SURFACE COUGHING I CLEARED MY LUNGS OF THE WATER I HAD INHALED I WAS WEAK AND SHAKING WHEN I FINISHED BUT MY HEAD WAS CLEAR THE GRIP OF THE STRANGE FANTASY THAT HAD GRIPPED ME WAS SHAKEN OFF
8088-284756-0115 MERCER WAS BENDING OVER ME SPEAKING SOFTLY I WAS WATCHING OLD MAN HE SAID GENTLY I CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED A MOMENTARY PSYCHIC FUSING OF AN ANCIENT LONG SINCE BROKEN LINK YOU TOGETHER WITH ALL MANKIND CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA
8088-284756-0116 BUT THERE IS NO RETRACING THE WAY I NODDED MY HEAD BOWED ON MY STREAMING CHEST SORRY MERCER I MUTTERED SOMETHING GOT INTO ME THOSE BIG EYES OF HERS SEEMED TO TUG AT THREADS OF MEMORY BURIED I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT
8088-284756-0117 IT HELPED JERK ME BACK TO THE NORMAL YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND AGAIN TAYLOR HE COMMENTED SOOTHINGLY I THINK THERE'S NO DANGER OF YOU LOSING YOUR GRIP ON TERRA FIRMA AGAIN SHALL WE CARRY ON THERE'S MORE YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN THAT YOU THINK SHE CAN GIVE US
8088-284756-0118 I ASKED HESITANTLY I BELIEVE REPLIED MERCER THAT SHE CAN GIVE US THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE IF WE CAN ONLY MAKE HER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WISH GOD IF WE ONLY COULD
8088-284756-0119 WE CAN TRY OLD TIMER I SAID A BIT SHAKENLY MERCER HURRIED BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL AND I ADJUSTED MY HEAD SET AGAIN SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL
8095-274345-0000 NO SOONER HAD CHARLES TAKEN INTO HIS HANDS THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT THAN HE SHOWED AN IMPATIENCE TO ASSEMBLE THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE NATION AND HE WOULD GLADLY FOR THE SAKE OF DESPATCH HAVE CALLED TOGETHER THE SAME PARLIAMENT WHICH HAD SITTEN UNDER HIS FATHER
8095-274345-0001 AND WHICH LAY AT THAT TIME UNDER PROROGATION BUT BEING TOLD THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD APPEAR UNUSUAL HE ISSUED WRITS FOR SUMMONING A NEW PARLIAMENT ON THE SEVENTH OF MAY AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA
8095-274345-0002 UNEXPERIENCED AND IMPOLITIC REGARDED AS SINCERE ALL THE PRAISES AND CARESSES WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN LOADED WHILE ACTIVE IN PROCURING THE RUPTURE WITH THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AND BESIDES THAT HE LABORED UNDER GREAT NECESSITIES
8095-274345-0003 HE LIGHTLY MENTIONED THE OCCASION WHICH HE HAD FOR SUPPLY HE EMPLOYED NO INTRIGUE TO INFLUENCE THE SUFFRAGES OF THE MEMBERS HE WOULD NOT EVEN ALLOW THE OFFICERS OF THE CROWN WHO HAD SEATS IN THE HOUSE
8095-274345-0004 AND THAT GREAT ANTICIPATIONS WERE LIKEWISE MADE ON THE REVENUES OF THE CROWN THEY WERE NOT IGNORANT THAT CHARLES WAS LOADED WITH A LARGE DEBT CONTRACTED BY HIS FATHER WHO HAD BORROWED MONEY BOTH FROM HIS OWN SUBJECTS AND FROM FOREIGN PRINCES
8095-274345-0005 THEY HAD LEARNED BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE PUBLIC REVENUE COULD WITH DIFFICULTY MAINTAIN THE DIGNITY OF THE CROWN EVEN UNDER THE ORDINARY CHARGES OF GOVERNMENT
8095-274345-0006 THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT THE PRESENT WAR WAS VERY LATELY THE RESULT OF THEIR OWN IMPORTUNATE APPLICATIONS AND ENTREATIES AND THAT THEY HAD SOLEMNLY ENGAGED TO SUPPORT THEIR SOVEREIGN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF IT
8095-274345-0007 THEY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MILITARY ENTERPRISES DIRECTED AGAINST THE WHOLE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AGAINST THE KING OF SPAIN POSSESSED OF THE GREATEST RICHES AND MOST EXTENSIVE DOMINIONS OF ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
8095-274345-0008 AGAINST THE EMPEROR FERDINAND HITHERTO THE MOST FORTUNATE MONARCH OF HIS AGE WHO HAD SUBDUED AND ASTONISHED GERMANY BY THE RAPIDITY OF HIS VICTORIES DEEP IMPRESSIONS THEY SAW MUST BE MADE BY THE ENGLISH SWORD
8095-274345-0009 AND A VIGOROUS OFFENSIVE WAR BE WAGED AGAINST THESE MIGHTY POTENTATES ERE THEY WOULD RESIGN A PRINCIPALITY WHICH THEY HAD NOW FULLY SUBDUED AND WHICH THEY HELD IN SECURE POSSESSION BY ITS BEING SURROUNDED WITH ALL THEIR OTHER TERRITORIES
8095-274345-0010 TO ANSWER THEREFORE ALL THESE GREAT AND IMPORTANT ENDS TO SATISFY THEIR YOUNG KING IN THE FIRST REQUEST WHICH HE MADE THEM TO PROVE THEIR SENSE OF THE MANY ROYAL VIRTUES PARTICULARLY ECONOMY WITH WHICH CHARLES WAS ENDUED
8095-274345-0011 THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONDUCTED BY THE WISEST AND ABLEST SENATORS THAT HAD EVER FLOURISHED IN ENGLAND THOUGHT PROPER TO CONFER ON THE KING A SUPPLY OF TWO SUBSIDIES
8095-274345-0012 WHICH THE PRESENT CONJUNCTURE COULD SUGGEST TO THEM IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT SPLEEN AND ILL WILL AGAINST THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HAD AN INFLUENCE WITH MANY SO VAST AND RAPID A FORTUNE SO LITTLE MERITED
8095-274345-0013 COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE PUBLIC ENVY AND HOWEVER MEN'S HATRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE DUKE'S CONDUCT SEEMED TO GRATIFY THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR PREJUDICES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM LONG TO PRESERVE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
8095-274345-0014 HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE MODESTY OF CHARLES EXCEEDED EVEN THAT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE WEAKNESS OF JAMES NOR WAS ANY PUBLIC MEASURE CONDUCTED BUT BY HIS COUNSEL AND DIRECTION
8095-274345-0015 HIS VEHEMENT TEMPER PROMPTED HIM TO RAISE SUDDENLY TO THE HIGHEST ELEVATION HIS FLATTERERS AND DEPENDANTS AND UPON THE LEAST OCCASION OF DISPLEASURE HE THREW THEM DOWN WITH EQUAL IMPETUOSITY AND VIOLENCE IMPLACABLE IN HIS HATRED
8095-274345-0016 FICKLE IN HIS FRIENDSHIPS ALL MEN WERE EITHER REGARDED AS HIS ENEMIES OR DREADED SOON TO BECOME SUCH THE WHOLE POWER OF THE KINGDOM WAS GRASPED BY HIS INSATIABLE HAND WHILE HE BOTH ENGROSSED THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF HIS MASTER
8095-274345-0017 AND HELD INVESTED IN HIS SINGLE PERSON THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OFFICES OF THE CROWN HOWEVER THE ILL HUMOR OF THE COMMONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS WE ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE THEM THE SOLE MOTIVES
8095-274345-0018 THE LAST PARLIAMENT OF JAMES AMIDST ALL THEIR JOY AND FESTIVITY HAD GIVEN HIM A SUPPLY VERY DISPROPORTIONED TO HIS DEMAND AND TO THE OCCASION AND AS EVERY HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH WAS ELECTED DURING FORTY YEARS
8095-274345-0019 SUCCEEDED TO ALL THE PASSIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS WE OUGHT RATHER TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS OBSTINACY FROM THE GENERAL SITUATION OF THE KINGDOM DURING THAT WHOLE PERIOD THAN FROM ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ATTENDED THIS PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE
