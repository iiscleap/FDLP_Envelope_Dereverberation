6437-66173-0036 ESCORTED BY TWO OR THREE OF THE SCHOOLFELLOWS I WALKED HOME THROUGH THE PLEASANT AUTUMN TWILIGHT BATTERED BUT TRIUMPHANT AS I WENT ALONG MY CAP COCKED ON ONE SIDE TO KEEP THE CHILLY AIR FROM MY EYE
6437-66173-0037 I FELT THAT I WAS NOT ONLY FOLLOWING MY NOSE BUT FOLLOWING IT SO CLOSELY THAT I WAS IN SOME DANGER OF TREADING ON IT I SEEMED TO HAVE NOSE ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE PARTY MY LEFT CHEEK ALSO WAS PUFFED OUT LIKE A DUMPLING
6437-66173-0038 I COULDN'T HELP SAYING TO MYSELF IF THIS IS VICTORY HOW ABOUT THAT OTHER FELLOW TOM SAID HARRY BLAKE HESITATING WELL
6437-66173-0039 DID YOU SEE MISTER GRIMSHAW LOOKING OUT OF THE RECITATION ROOM WINDOW JUST AS WE LEFT THE YARD NO WAS HE THOUGH I AM SURE OF IT
6437-66173-0040 SHOULDN'T WONDER NO HE DIDN'T BROKE IN ADAMS OR HE WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT SHORT METRE
6437-66173-0041 WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW I REFLECTED AS THE MONKEY SAID WHEN HE FELL OUT OF THE COCOANUT TREE ADDED CHARLEY MARDEN TRYING TO MAKE ME LAUGH IT WAS EARLY CANDLE LIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE
6437-66173-0042 MISS ABIGAIL OPENING THE FRONT DOOR STARTED BACK AT MY HILARIOUS APPEARANCE I TRIED TO SMILE UPON HER SWEETLY BUT THE SMILE RIPPLING OVER MY SWOLLEN CHEEK AND DYING AWAY LIKE A SPENT WAVE ON MY NOSE
6437-66173-0043 PRODUCED AN EXPRESSION OF WHICH MISS ABIGAIL DECLARED SHE HAD NEVER SEEN THE LIKE EXCEPTING ON THE FACE OF A CHINESE IDOL SHE HUSTLED ME UNCEREMONIOUSLY INTO THE PRESENCE OF MY GRANDFATHER IN THE SITTING ROOM
6437-66173-0044 CAPTAIN NUTTER AS THE RECOGNIZED PROFESSIONAL WARRIOR OF OUR FAMILY COULD NOT CONSISTENTLY TAKE ME TO TASK FOR FIGHTING CONWAY NOR WAS HE DISPOSED TO DO SO
6437-66173-0045 FOR THE CAPTAIN WAS WELL AWARE OF THE LONG CONTINUED PROVOCATION I HAD ENDURED AH YOU RASCAL CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AFTER HEARING MY STORY JUST LIKE ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG ALWAYS IN ONE KIND OF TROUBLE OR ANOTHER
6437-66173-0046 I BELIEVE IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY I THINK SAID MISS ABIGAIL WITHOUT THE FAINTEST EXPRESSION ON HER COUNTENANCE THAT A TABLE SPOONFUL OF HOT DRO THE CAPTAIN INTERRUPTED MISS ABIGAIL PEREMPTORILY
6437-66173-0047 DIRECTING HER TO MAKE A SHADE OUT OF CARDBOARD AND BLACK SILK TO TIE OVER MY EYE MISS ABIGAIL MUST HAVE BEEN POSSESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT I HAD TAKEN UP PUGILISM AS A PROFESSION FOR SHE TURNED OUT NO FEWER THAN SIX OF THESE BLINDERS
6437-66173-0048 THEY'LL BE HANDY TO HAVE IN THE HOUSE SAYS MISS ABIGAIL GRIMLY OF COURSE SO GREAT A BREACH OF DISCIPLINE WAS NOT TO BE PASSED OVER BY MISTER GRIMSHAW
6437-66173-0049 HE HAD AS WE SUSPECTED WITNESSED THE CLOSING SCENE OF THE FIGHT FROM THE SCHOOL ROOM WINDOW AND THE NEXT MORNING AFTER PRAYERS I WAS NOT WHOLLY UNPREPARED WHEN MASTER CONWAY AND MYSELF WERE CALLED UP TO THE DESK FOR EXAMINATION
6437-66173-0050 AS THE READER IS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE LEADING POINTS IN THE CASE OF BAILEY VERSUS CONWAY I SHALL NOT REPORT THE TRIAL FURTHER THAN TO SAY THAT ADAMS MARDEN AND SEVERAL OTHER PUPILS TESTIFIED TO THE FACT
6437-66173-0051 THAT CONWAY HAD IMPOSED ON ME EVER SINCE MY FIRST DAY AT THE TEMPLE SCHOOL THEIR EVIDENCE ALSO WENT TO SHOW THAT CONWAY WAS A QUARRELSOME CHARACTER GENERALLY BAD FOR CONWAY SETH RODGERS ON THE PART OF HIS FRIEND
6437-66173-0052 PROVED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE FIRST BLOW THAT WAS BAD FOR ME IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID BINNY WALLACE HOLDING UP HIS HAND FOR PERMISSION TO SPEAK BAILEY DIDN'T FIGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE FOUGHT ON MY ACCOUNT AND IF YOU PLEASE SIR
6437-66173-0053 I AM THE BOY TO BE BLAMED FOR I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE THIS DREW OUT THE STORY OF CONWAY'S HARSH TREATMENT OF THE SMALLER BOYS AS BINNY RELATED THE WRONGS OF HIS PLAYFELLOWS SAYING VERY LITTLE OF HIS OWN GRIEVANCES
6437-66173-0054 I NOTICED THAT MISTER GRIMSHAW'S HAND UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF PERHAPS RESTED LIGHTLY FROM TIME TO TIME ON WALLACE'S SUNNY HAIR THE EXAMINATION FINISHED MISTER GRIMSHAW LEANED ON THE DESK THOUGHTFULLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID
6437-66173-0055 EVERY BOY IN THIS SCHOOL KNOWS THAT IT IS AGAINST THE RULES TO FIGHT IF ONE BOY MALTREATS ANOTHER WITHIN SCHOOL BOUNDS OR WITHIN SCHOOL HOURS THAT IS A MATTER FOR ME TO SETTLE THE CASE SHOULD BE LAID BEFORE ME
6437-66173-0056 I DISAPPROVE OF TALE BEARING I NEVER ENCOURAGE IT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE BUT WHEN ONE PUPIL SYSTEMATICALLY PERSECUTES A SCHOOLMATE IT IS THE DUTY OF SOME HEAD BOY TO INFORM ME NO PUPIL HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE THE LAW INTO HIS OWN HANDS
6437-66173-0057 IF THERE IS ANY FIGHTING TO BE DONE I AM THE PERSON TO BE CONSULTED I DISAPPROVE OF BOYS FIGHTING IT IS UNNECESSARY AND UNCHRISTIAN IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE I CONSIDER EVERY LARGE BOY IN THIS SCHOOL AT FAULT
6437-66173-0058 BUT AS THE OFFENCE IS ONE OF OMISSION RATHER THAN COMMISSION MY PUNISHMENT MUST REST ONLY ON THE TWO BOYS CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANOR CONWAY LOSES HIS RECESS FOR A MONTH AND BAILEY HAS A PAGE ADDED TO HIS LATIN LESSONS FOR THE NEXT FOUR RECITATIONS
6437-66173-0059 I NOW REQUEST BAILEY AND CONWAY TO SHAKE HANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SCHOOL AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR REGRET AT WHAT HAS OCCURRED CONWAY AND I APPROACHED EACH OTHER SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY AS IF WE WERE BENT UPON ANOTHER HOSTILE COLLISION
6437-66173-0060 WE CLASPED HANDS IN THE TAMEST MANNER IMAGINABLE AND CONWAY MUMBLED I'M SORRY I FOUGHT WITH YOU I THINK YOU ARE I REPLIED DRILY AND I'M SORRY I HAD TO THRASH YOU
6437-66173-0061 YOU CAN GO TO YOUR SEATS SAID MISTER GRIMSHAW TURNING HIS FACE ASIDE TO HIDE A SMILE I AM SURE MY APOLOGY WAS A VERY GOOD ONE I NEVER HAD ANY MORE TROUBLE WITH CONWAY
6437-66173-0062 HE AND HIS SHADOW SETH RODGERS GAVE ME A WIDE BERTH FOR MANY MONTHS NOR WAS BINNY WALLACE SUBJECTED TO FURTHER MOLESTATION MISS ABIGAIL'S SANITARY STORES INCLUDING A BOTTLE OF OPODELDOC WERE NEVER CALLED INTO REQUISITION
6476-57446-0000 BUT IN THE MIDST OF GAIETY HIS HEART YEARNED ALL THE WHILE FOR HIS LOST LOVE AND HIS MERRIMENT WAS BUT MOURNING IN DISGUISE AT LAST THE NIGHT WORE ON AND AS HE WAS RETIRING ALONG THE CORRIDOR HE SAW A MAN OF ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE
6476-57446-0001 WITH LONG HAIR COMING TOWARDS HIM WHO WHEN HE SAW GENZABURO CRIED OUT DEAR ME WHY THIS MUST BE MY YOUNG LORD GENZABURO WHO HAS COME OUT TO ENJOY HIMSELF GENZABURO THOUGHT THIS RATHER STRANGE BUT
6476-57446-0002 LOOKING AT THE MAN ATTENTIVELY RECOGNIZED HIM AS A RETAINER WHOM HE HAD HAD IN HIS EMPLOY THE YEAR BEFORE AND SAID THIS IS A CURIOUS MEETING PRAY WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABOUT SINCE YOU LEFT MY SERVICE AT ANY RATE
6476-57446-0003 I MAY CONGRATULATE YOU ON BEING WELL AND STRONG WHERE ARE YOU LIVING NOW WELL SIR SINCE I PARTED FROM YOU I HAVE BEEN EARNING A LIVING AS A FORTUNE TELLER AT KANDA AND HAVE CHANGED MY NAME TO KAJI SAZEN
6476-57446-0004 I AM LIVING IN A POOR AND HUMBLE HOUSE BUT IF YOUR LORDSHIP AT YOUR LEISURE WOULD HONOUR ME WITH A VISIT WELL IT'S A LUCKY CHANCE THAT HAS BROUGHT US TOGETHER AND I CERTAINLY WILL GO AND SEE YOU BESIDES I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME
6476-57446-0005 SHALL YOU BE AT HOME THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW CERTAINLY SIR I SHALL MAKE A POINT OF BEING AT HOME VERY WELL THEN THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW I WILL GO TO YOUR HOUSE I SHALL BE AT YOUR SERVICE SIR AND NOW AS IT IS GETTING LATE
6476-57446-0006 I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE FOR TO NIGHT GOOD NIGHT THEN WE SHALL MEET THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW AND SO THE TWO PARTED AND WENT THEIR SEVERAL WAYS TO REST ON THE APPOINTED DAY GENZABURO MADE HIS PREPARATIONS AND WENT IN DISGUISE WITHOUT ANY RETAINERS
6476-57446-0007 TO CALL UPON SAZEN WHO MET HIM AT THE PORCH OF HIS HOUSE AND SAID THIS IS A GREAT HONOUR MY LORD GENZABURO IS INDEED WELCOME MY HOUSE IS VERY MEAN BUT LET ME INVITE YOUR LORDSHIP TO COME INTO AN INNER CHAMBER
6476-57446-0008 PRAY REPLIED GENZABURO DON'T MAKE ANY CEREMONY FOR ME DON'T PUT YOURSELF TO ANY TROUBLE ON MY ACCOUNT AND SO HE PASSED IN AND SAZEN CALLED TO HIS WIFE TO PREPARE WINE AND CONDIMENTS AND THEY BEGAN TO FEAST
6476-57446-0009 AT LAST GENZABURO LOOKING SAZEN IN THE FACE SAID THERE IS A SERVICE WHICH I WANT YOU TO RENDER ME A VERY SECRET SERVICE BUT AS IF YOU WERE TO REFUSE ME I SHOULD BE PUT TO SHAME BEFORE I TELL YOU WHAT THAT SERVICE IS
6476-57446-0010 WELL THEN SAID GENZABURO GREATLY PLEASED AND DRAWING TEN RIYOS FROM HIS BOSOM THIS IS BUT A SMALL PRESENT TO MAKE TO YOU ON MY FIRST VISIT BUT PRAY ACCEPT IT NO INDEED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR LORDSHIP WISHES OF ME
6476-57446-0011 HOW HE HAD FIRST MET HER AND FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER AT THE ADZUMA BRIDGE HOW CHOKICHI HAD INTRODUCED HER TO HIM AT THE TEA HOUSE AT OJI AND THEN WHEN SHE FELL ILL AND HE WANTED TO SEE HER AGAIN INSTEAD OF BRINGING HER TO HIM HAD ONLY GIVEN HIM GOOD ADVICE
6476-57446-0012 AND SO GENZABURO DREW A LAMENTABLE PICTURE OF HIS STATE OF DESPAIR SAZEN LISTENED PATIENTLY TO HIS STORY AND AFTER REFLECTING FOR A WHILE REPLIED WELL SIR IT'S NOT A DIFFICULT MATTER TO SET RIGHT
6476-57446-0013 WHEN GENZABURO HEARD THIS HE FELT GREATLY RELIEVED AND RECOMMENDING SAZEN TO DO HIS BEST IN THE MATTER TOOK HIS LEAVE AND RETURNED HOME THAT VERY NIGHT SAZEN AFTER THINKING OVER ALL THAT GENZABURO HAD TOLD HIM
6476-57446-0014 LAID HIS PLANS ACCORDINGLY AND WENT OFF TO THE HOUSE OF KIHACHI THE ETA CHIEF AND TOLD HIM THE COMMISSION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED KIHACHI WAS OF COURSE GREATLY ASTONISHED AND SAID SOME TIME AGO SIR CHOKICHI CAME HERE
6476-57446-0015 AND SAID THAT MY LORD GENZABURO HAVING BEEN REBUKED BY HIS FAMILY FOR HIS PROFLIGATE BEHAVIOUR HAD DETERMINED TO BREAK OFF HIS CONNECTION WITH MY DAUGHTER OF COURSE I KNEW THAT THE DAUGHTER OF AN ETA WAS NO FITTING MATCH FOR A NOBLEMAN
6476-57446-0016 SO WHEN CHOKICHI CAME AND TOLD ME THE ERRAND UPON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SENT I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO ANNOUNCE TO MY DAUGHTER THAT SHE MUST GIVE UP ALL THOUGHT OF HIS LORDSHIP SINCE THAT TIME SHE HAS BEEN FRETTING AND PINING AND STARVING FOR LOVE
6476-57446-0017 BUT WHEN I TELL HER WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID HOW GLAD AND HAPPY SHE WILL BE LET ME GO AND TALK TO HER AT ONCE
6476-57446-0018 WELL AT ANY RATE I HAVE SOME NEWS FOR YOU THAT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY A MESSENGER HAS COME FROM MY LORD GENZABURO FOR WHOM YOUR HEART YEARNS AT THIS O KOYO WHO HAD BEEN CROUCHING DOWN LIKE A DROOPING FLOWER GAVE A GREAT START AND CRIED OUT IS THAT REALLY TRUE
6476-57446-0019 IT IS CHOKICHI WHO HAS BEEN THROWING OBSTACLES IN THE WAY AT LAST HIS LORDSHIP HAS SECRETLY SENT A MAN CALLED KAJI SAZEN A FORTUNE TELLER TO ARRANGE AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN YOU SO NOW MY CHILD YOU MAY CHEER UP
6476-57446-0020 AND GO TO MEET YOUR LOVER AS SOON AS YOU PLEASE WHEN O KOYO HEARD THIS SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE THOUGHT IT MUST ALL BE A DREAM AND DOUBTED HER OWN SENSES KIHACHI IN THE MEANWHILE REJOINED SAZEN IN THE OTHER ROOM AND
6476-57446-0021 AFTER TELLING HIM OF THE JOY WITH WHICH HIS DAUGHTER HAD HEARD THE NEWS PUT BEFORE HIM WINE AND OTHER DELICACIES I THINK SAID SAZEN THAT THE BEST WAY WOULD BE FOR O KOYO TO LIVE SECRETLY IN MY LORD GENZABURO'S HOUSE
6476-57446-0022 BUT AS IT WILL NEVER DO FOR ALL THE WORLD TO KNOW OF IT IT MUST BE MANAGED VERY QUIETLY AND FURTHER WHEN I GET HOME I MUST THINK OUT SOME PLAN TO LULL THE SUSPICIONS OF THAT FELLOW CHOKICHI AND LET YOU KNOW MY IDEA BY LETTER
6476-57446-0023 MEANWHILE O KOYO HAD BETTER COME HOME WITH ME TO NIGHT ALTHOUGH SHE IS SO TERRIBLY OUT OF SPIRITS NOW SHE SHALL MEET GENZABURO THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW KIHACHI REPORTED THIS TO O KOYO AND AS HER PINING FOR GENZABURO WAS THE ONLY CAUSE OF HER SICKNESS
6476-57446-0024 SHE RECOVERED HER SPIRITS AT ONCE AND SAYING THAT SHE WOULD GO WITH SAZEN IMMEDIATELY JOYFULLY MADE HER PREPARATIONS THEN SAZEN HAVING ONCE MORE WARNED KIHACHI TO KEEP THE MATTER SECRET FROM CHOKICHI AND TO ACT UPON THE LETTER WHICH HE SHOULD SEND HIM
6476-57446-0025 RETURNED HOME TAKING WITH HIM O KOYO AND AFTER O KOYO HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HER HAIR AND PAINTED HERSELF AND PUT ON BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES SHE CAME OUT LOOKING SO LOVELY THAT NO PRINCESS IN THE LAND COULD VIE WITH HER AND SAZEN WHEN HE SAW HER
6476-57446-0026 SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NO WONDER THAT GENZABURO HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER THEN AS IT WAS GETTING LATE HE ADVISED HER TO GO TO REST AND AFTER SHOWING HER TO HER APARTMENTS WENT TO HIS OWN ROOM AND WROTE HIS LETTER TO KIHACHI
6476-57446-0027 CONTAINING THE SCHEME WHICH HE HAD DEVISED WHEN KIHACHI RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS HE WAS FILLED WITH ADMIRATION AT SAZEN'S INGENUITY AND PUTTING ON AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT ALARM AND AGITATION
6476-57446-0028 WENT OFF IMMEDIATELY TO CALL ON CHOKICHI AND SAID TO HIM OH MASTER CHOKICHI SUCH A TERRIBLE THING HAS HAPPENED PRAY LET ME TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT INDEED WHAT CAN IT BE OH SIR ANSWERED KIHACHI
6476-57446-0029 PRETENDING TO WIPE AWAY HIS TEARS MY DAUGHTER O KOYO MOURNING OVER HER SEPARATION FROM MY LORD GENZABURO AT FIRST REFUSED ALL SUSTENANCE AND REMAINED NURSING HER SORROWS UNTIL LAST NIGHT HER WOMAN'S HEART FAILING TO BEAR UP AGAINST HER GREAT GRIEF
6476-57446-0030 SHE DROWNED HERSELF IN THE RIVER LEAVING BEHIND HER A PAPER ON WHICH SHE HAD WRITTEN HER INTENTION WHEN CHOKICHI HEARD THIS HE WAS THUNDERSTRUCK AND EXCLAIMED CAN THIS REALLY BE TRUE AND WHEN I THINK THAT IT WAS I WHO FIRST INTRODUCED HER TO MY LORD
6476-57446-0031 I AM ASHAMED TO LOOK YOU IN THE FACE OH SAY NOT SO MISFORTUNES ARE THE PUNISHMENT DUE FOR OUR MISDEEDS IN A FORMER STATE OF EXISTENCE I BEAR YOU NO ILL WILL THIS MONEY WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND WAS MY DAUGHTER'S
6476-57446-0032 TO YOU THROUGH WHOSE INTERVENTION SHE BECAME ALLIED WITH A NOBLEMAN
6476-57446-0033 YOU AMAZE ME REPLIED THE OTHER HOW COULD I ABOVE ALL MEN
6476-57446-0034 AT LAST CHOKICHI AFTER MUCH PERSUASION AND GREATLY TO HIS OWN DISTRESS WAS OBLIGED TO ACCEPT THE MONEY AND WHEN KIHACHI HAD CARRIED OUT ALL SAZEN'S INSTRUCTIONS HE RETURNED HOME
6476-57446-0035 AND AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT IT WAS THE VERY LETTER WHICH CONTAINED SAZEN'S INSTRUCTIONS TO KIHACHI AND IN WHICH THE WHOLE STORY WHICH HAD JUST AFFECTED HIM SO MUCH WAS MADE UP WHEN HE PERCEIVED THE TRICK THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED UPON HIM HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND EXCLAIMED
6476-57446-0036 AND ALL IN VAIN WELL THEY'VE GULLED ME ONCE BUT I'LL BE EVEN WITH THEM YET AND HINDER THEIR GAME BEFORE IT IS PLAYED OUT
6476-57446-0037 AND WENT OFF SECRETLY TO PROWL ABOUT SAZEN'S HOUSE TO WATCH FOR O KOYO DETERMINED TO PAY OFF GENZABURO AND SAZEN FOR THEIR CONDUCT TO HIM IN THE MEANWHILE SAZEN WHO DID NOT FOR A MOMENT SUSPECT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
6476-57446-0038 WHEN THE DAY WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED UPON BY HIM AND GENZABURO ARRIVED MADE O KOYO PUT ON HER BEST CLOTHES SMARTENED UP HIS HOUSE AND GOT READY A FEAST AGAINST GENZABURO'S ARRIVAL THE LATTER CAME PUNCTUALLY TO HIS TIME
6476-57446-0039 AND GOING IN AT ONCE SAID TO THE FORTUNE TELLER
6476-57446-0040 LOST HEART ENTIRELY AND MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO HOME AGAIN SAZEN HOWEVER PRESSED HIM SO EAGERLY THAT AT LAST HE WENT UPSTAIRS TO SEE THIS VAUNTED BEAUTY AND SAZEN DRAWING ASIDE A SCREEN SHOWED HIM O KOYO WHO WAS SITTING THERE
6476-57446-0041 PRAY DON'T MENTION IT SIR BUT AS IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE YOU HAVE MET THE YOUNG LADY YOU MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER SO I WILL GO DOWNSTAIRS AND IF YOU WANT ANYTHING PRAY CALL ME AND SO HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND LEFT THEM
6476-57446-0042 THEN GENZABURO ADDRESSING O KOYO SAID AH IT IS INDEED A LONG TIME SINCE WE MET HOW HAPPY IT MAKES ME TO SEE YOU AGAIN WHY YOUR FACE HAS GROWN QUITE THIN POOR THING HAVE YOU BEEN UNHAPPY
6476-57446-0043 AND O KOYO WITH THE TEARS STARTING FROM HER EYES FOR JOY HID HER FACE AND HER HEART WAS SO FULL THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK BUT GENZABURO PASSING HIS HAND GENTLY OVER HER HEAD AND BACK AND COMFORTING HER SAID
6476-57446-0044 COME SWEETHEART THERE IS NO NEED TO SOB SO TALK TO ME A LITTLE AND LET ME HEAR YOUR VOICE AT LAST O KOYO RAISED HER HEAD AND SAID AH
6476-57446-0045 AND THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD NEVER MEET YOU AGAIN HOW TENDERLY I THOUGHT OF YOU
6476-57446-0046 SAZEN CAME WITH A MESSAGE FROM YOU I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL A DREAM AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE BENT HER HEAD AND SOBBED AGAIN AND IN GENZABURO'S EYES SHE SEEMED MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER
6476-57446-0047 WITH HER PALE DELICATE FACE AND HE LOVED HER BETTER THAN BEFORE THEN SHE SAID
6476-57446-0048 I SHOULD NEVER STOP YES REPLIED GENZABURO I TOO HAVE SUFFERED MUCH AND SO THEY TOLD ONE ANOTHER THEIR MUTUAL GRIEFS AND FROM THAT DAY FORTH THEY CONSTANTLY MET AT SAZEN'S HOUSE
6476-57446-0049 ONE DAY AS THEY WERE FEASTING AND ENJOYING THEMSELVES IN AN UPPER STOREY IN SAZEN'S HOUSE CHOKICHI CAME TO THE HOUSE AND SAID I BEG PARDON BUT DOES ONE MASTER SAZEN LIVE HERE CERTAINLY SIR I AM SAZEN AT YOUR SERVICE

6476-57446-0051 I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING WHY I THOUGHT YOU WERE SOME RESPECTABLE PERSON AND YOU HAVE THE IMPUDENCE TO TELL ME THAT YOUR NAME IS CHOKICHI

6476-57446-0055 THERE IS NO O KOYO HERE AND I NEVER SAW SUCH A PERSON IN MY LIFE CHOKICHI QUIETLY DREW OUT OF THE BOSOM OF HIS DRESS THE LETTER FROM SAZEN TO KIHACHI WHICH HE HAD PICKED UP A FEW DAYS BEFORE AND SHOWING IT TO SAZEN REPLIED

6476-57446-0063 AND SAZEN PROFITING BY THE CHANCE DREW HIS DIRK AND STABBED HIM IN THE SIDE AND AS CHOKICHI TAKEN BY SURPRISE TRIED TO GET UP HE CUT HIM SEVERELY OVER THE HEAD UNTIL AT LAST HE FELL DEAD
6476-57446-0064 SAZEN THEN LOOKING AROUND HIM AND SEEING TO HIS GREAT DELIGHT THAT THERE WAS NO ONE NEAR RETURNED HOME THE FOLLOWING DAY CHOKICHI'S BODY WAS FOUND BY THE POLICE AND WHEN THEY EXAMINED IT THEY FOUND NOTHING UPON IT SAVE A PAPER WHICH THEY READ
