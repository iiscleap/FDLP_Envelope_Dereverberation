6818-76332-0055 MISSUS COLLINGWOOD CAME CLOSER AND UTTERED A SUDDEN LOW CRY MY SON MOTHER THE TWO GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THIS SCENE WITH AMAZEMENT UNUTTERABLE
6818-76332-0056 THEN WITH A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE THE MAN HELD OUT HIS ARMS AND THE WOMAN WITH A LITTLE GASP OF HAPPINESS
6836-61803-0000 IT IS NOW EVENING AND THE SUNBEAMS FALLING ASLANT INTRUDE UPON THE SPACE CANOPIED BY THE TREE FROM THE GOLDEN BRIGHTNESS DISPLAYED BY THEM AT NOON
6836-61803-0001 AS IF THERE WAS ANGER IN THE SKY IT IS BUT AN ACCIDENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE PORTENT OF AN APPROACHING STORM
6836-61803-0002 FOR ALL THIS IT IS REMARKED AS SINGULAR THAT A STORM SHOULD BE COMING AT THE TIME SINCE IT SYMBOLISES THE SENTIMENT OF THE SPECTATORS WHO LOOK ON WITH SULLENNESS IN THEIR HEARTS AND GLOOM IN THEIR GLANCES
6836-61803-0003 IT WOULD SEEM AS IF HEAVEN'S WRATH WAS ACTING IN CONCERT WITH THE PASSIONS OF EARTH MAURICE GERALD IS NO LONGER THE CYNOSURE OF THOSE SCOWLING EYES HE HAS BEEN CLAMOROUSLY ACQUITTED
6836-61803-0004 AND IS HENCEFORTH ONLY ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN THE PLACE LATE OCCUPIED BY HIM ANOTHER STANDS CASSIUS CALHOUN IS NOW THE PRISONER AT THE BAR
6836-61803-0005 THIS IS THE ONLY CHANGE OBSERVABLE THE JUDGE IS THE SAME THE JURY THE SAME AND THE SPECTATORS AS BEFORE THOUGH WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS IN REGARD TO THE CRIMINALITY OF THE ACCUSED
6836-61803-0006 IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT THE EVIDENCE IS ALREADY BEFORE THEM AND THOUGH ENTIRELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL AS IN MOST CASES OF MURDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES FORM A CHAIN IRRESISTIBLY CONCLUSIVE AND COMPLETE
6836-61803-0007 THERE IS BUT ONE MISSING LINK IF LINK IT MAY BE CALLED THE MOTIVE THE MOTIVE BOTH FOR THE MURDER AND THE MUTILATION
6836-61803-0008 FOR THE TESTIMONY OF GERALD HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY A SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION OF THE DEAD BODY THE SURGEON OF THE CANTONMENT HAS PRONOUNCED THE TWO DISTINCT AND THAT HENRY POINDEXTER'S DEATH
6836-61803-0009 MUST HAVE ENSUED ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY AFTER HIS RECEIVING THE SHOT WHY SHOULD CASSIUS CALHOUN HAVE KILLED HIS OWN COUSIN WHY CUT OFF HIS HEAD NO ONE CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS
6836-61803-0010 SAVE THE MURDERER HIMSELF NO ONE EXPECTS HIM TO DO SO SAVE TO HIS MAKER BEFORE HIM HE MUST SOON STAND FOR A KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOTIVE IS NOT DEEMED ESSENTIAL TO HIS CONDEMNATION
6836-61803-0011 AND HE HAS BEEN CONDEMNED THE TRIAL HAS COME TO A CLOSE THE VERDICT GUILTY HAS BEEN GIVEN AND THE JUDGE LAYING ASIDE HIS PANAMA HAT IS ABOUT TO PUT ON THE BLACK CAP
6836-61803-0012 THAT DREAD EMBLEM OF DEATH PREPARATORY TO PRONOUNCING THE SENTENCE IN THE USUAL SOLEMN MANNER THE CONDEMNED MAN IS INVITED TO MAKE HIS FINAL SPEECH TO AVAIL HIMSELF AS IT WERE
6836-61803-0013 HE STARTS AT THE INVITATION FALLING AS IT DOES LIKE A DEATH KNELL UPON HIS EAR HE LOOKS WILDLY AROUND DESPAIRINGLY
6836-61803-0014 WHEN ON THE FACES THAT ENCIRCLE HIM HE SEES NOT ONE WEARING AN EXPRESSION OF SYMPATHY THERE IS NOT EVEN PITY ALL APPEAR TO FROWN UPON HIM
6836-61803-0015 HIS CONFEDERATES THOSE PAYED RUFFIANS WHO HAVE HITHERTO SUPPORTED HIM ARE OF NO USE NOW AND THEIR SYMPATHY OF NO CONSEQUENCE THEY HAVE SHRUNK OUT OF SIGHT
6836-61803-0016 BEFORE THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW AND THE DAMNING EVIDENCE OF HIS GUILT DESPITE HIS SOCIAL STANDING AND THE WEALTH TO SUSTAIN IT HE SEES HIMSELF ALONE WITHOUT FRIEND OR SYMPATHISER
6836-61803-0017 FOR SO STANDS THE ASSASSIN IN TEXAS HIS DEMEANOUR IS COMPLETELY CHANGED
6836-61803-0018 OFT EXHIBITED IN BOLD BRUTAL BULLYISM HE LOOKS COWED AND CRAVEN AND NOT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD HE FEELS THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE OF ESCAPE THAT HE IS STANDING BY THE SIDE OF HIS COFFIN
6836-61803-0019 ON THE EDGE OF AN ETERNITY TOO TERRIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE TO A CONSCIENCE LIKE HIS IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE THAN APPALLING ALL AT ONCE A LIGHT IS SEEN TO FLASK INTO HIS EYES
6836-61803-0020 SUNKEN AS THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF TWO LIVID CIRCLES HE HAS THE AIR OF ONE ON THE EVE OF MAKING CONFESSION IS IT TO BE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUILT
6836-61803-0021 IS HE ABOUT TO UNBURDEN HIS CONSCIENCE OF THE WEIGHT THAT MUST BE ON IT THE SPECTATORS GUESSING HIS INTENTION STAND BREATHLESSLY OBSERVING HIM THERE IS SILENCE EVEN AMONG THE CICADAS
6836-61803-0022 IT IS BROKEN BY THE FORMALISED INTERROGATORY OF THE JUDGE HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO SAY WHY SENTENCE OF DEATH SHOULD NOT BE PRONOUNCED UPON YOU NO HE REPLIES I HAVE NOT
6836-61803-0023 THE JURY HAS GIVEN A JUST VERDICT I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE FORFEITED MY LIFE AND DESERVE TO LOSE IT
6836-61803-0024 SHOT HIM DEAD IN THE CHAPPARAL
6836-61803-0025 AND EXPRESSES HORROR RATHER THAN INDIGNATION ALIKE INVOLUNTARY IS THE GROAN THAT GOES WITH IT PROCEEDING FROM A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL WHOM ALL KNOW TO BE THE FATHER OF THE MURDERED MAN
6836-61803-0026 ONCE MORE IN THEIR MIDST BEYOND THESE SOUNDS SOON CEASING THERE IS NOTHING TO HINDER THE CONFESSION FROM BEING CONTINUED I KNOW THAT I'VE GOT TO DIE PROCEEDS THE PRISONER WITH AN AIR OF SEEMING RECKLESSNESS
6836-61803-0027 AFTER WHAT I'VE CONFESSED IT WOULD BE FOLLY IN ME TO EXPECT PARDON AND I DON'T I'VE BEEN A BAD FELLOW AND NO DOUBT HAVE DONE ENOUGH TO DESERVE MY FATE BUT BAD AS I MAY HAVE BEEN
6836-61803-0028 IMPUTATION OF HAVING MURDERED MY OWN COUSIN I DID TAKE HIS LIFE AS I'VE TOLD YOU YOU ARE ALL ASKING WHY AND CONJECTURING ABOUT THE MOTIVE THERE WAS NONE
6836-61803-0029 A NEW SENSATION MAKES ITSELF MANIFEST AMONG THE SPECTATORS IT PARTAKES OF SURPRISE CURIOSITY AND INCREDULITY NO ONE SPEAKS OR IN ANY WAY ATTEMPTS INTERRUPTION
6836-61803-0030 YOU WONDER AT THAT IT'S EASILY EXPLAINED I KILLED HIM BY MISTAKE THE SURPRISE CULMINATES IN A SHOUT SUPPRESSED AS THE SPEAKER PROCEEDS YES BY MISTAKE
6836-61803-0031 AND GOD KNOWS I WAS SORRY ENOUGH ON DISCOVERING THAT I HAD MADE IT I DIDN'T KNOW MYSELF TILL LONG AFTER THE CONDEMNED MAN LOOKS UP AS IF IN HOPES THAT HE HAS TOUCHED A CHORD OF MERCY
6836-61803-0032 THERE IS NO SIGN OF IT ON THE FACES THAT SURROUND HIM STILL SOLEMNLY AUSTERE
6836-61803-0033 CONTINUES HE I NEEDN'T THAT I INTENDED TO KILL SOME ONE I DID NOR AM I GOING TO DENY WHO IT WAS IT WAS THE CUR I SEE STANDING BEFORE ME IN A GLANCE OF CONCENTRATED HATRED
6836-61803-0034 THE SPEAKER RESTS HIS EYE
6836-61803-0035 WHO ONLY ANSWERS WITH A LOOK SO CALM AS ALMOST TO BETRAY INDIFFERENCE YES I INTENDED TO KILL HIM I HAD MY REASONS I'M NOT GOING TO SAY WHAT THEY WERE IT'S NO USE NOW
6836-61803-0036 AND FATAL TO A FRIEND IT WAS SURE ENOUGH AND POOR HENRY DROPPED FROM HIS HORSE
6836-61803-0037 EITHER ABOUT THE MURDER OR ITS MOTIVE AND THE PRISONER IS SPARED FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THAT FIENDISH DEED THAT LEFT THE DEAD BODY OF HENRY POINDEXTER WITHOUT A HEAD
6836-61803-0038 YOU KNOW ALL THAT'S PASSED BUT NOT WHAT'S TO COME
6836-61803-0039 YOU SEE ME STANDING ON MY GRAVE
6836-61803-0040 TILL I'VE SENT HIM TO HIS I DON'T BY GOD THERE IS NO NEED TO GUESS AT THE MEANING OF THIS PROFANE SPEECH THE LAST OF CALHOUN'S LIFE ITS MEANING IS MADE CLEAR BY THE ACT THAT ACCOMPANIES IT
6836-61803-0041 WHILE SPEAKING HE HAS KEPT HIS RIGHT HAND UNDER THE LEFT BREAST OF HIS COAT ALONG WITH THE OATH IT COMES FORTH HOLDING A REVOLVER THE SPECTATORS HAVE JUST TIME TO SEE THE PISTOL
6836-61803-0042 AS IT GLINTS UNDER THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS WHEN TWO SHOTS ARE HEARD IN QUICK SUCCESSION WITH A LIKE INTERVAL BETWEEN TWO MEN FALL FORWARD UPON THEIR FACES AND LIE WITH THEIR HEADS CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS
6836-61803-0043 THE CROWD CLOSES AROUND BELIEVING BOTH TO BE DEAD
6836-61804-0000 WHO CAN BLAME HER FOR GIVING WAY TO THE SUBDUED HAPPINESS THAT SUCCEEDED NOT I NOT YOU IF YOU SPEAK TRULY THE PASSION THAT CONTROLLED HER MAY NOT BE POPULAR UNDER A STRICTLY PURITAN STANDARD
6836-61804-0001 UNIVERSAL AND IRRESISTIBLE TELLING US THAT FATHER MOTHER SISTER AND BROTHER ARE ALL TO BE FORSAKEN FOR THAT LOVE ILLIMITABLE
6836-61804-0002 DO NOT REPROACH THE YOUNG CREOLE BECAUSE THIS PASSION WAS PARAMOUNT IN HER SOUL DO NOT BLAME HER FOR FEELING PLEASURE AMIDST MOMENTS THAT SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO SADNESS
6836-61804-0003 NOR THAT HER HAPPINESS WAS HEIGHTENED ON LEARNING FROM THE ASTONISHED SPECTATORS HOW HER LOVER'S LIFE HAD BEEN PRESERVED AS IT MIGHT SEEM MIRACULOUSLY THE AIM OF THE ASSASSIN
6836-61804-0004 HAD BEEN TRUE ENOUGH HE MUST HAVE FELT SURE OF IT BEFORE TURNING THE MUZZLE TOWARDS HIS OWN TEMPLES AND FIRING THE BULLET THAT HAD LODGED IN HIS BRAIN
6836-61804-0005 RIGHT OVER THE HEART HE HAD HIT HIS INTENDED VICTIM AND THROUGH THE HEART WOULD THE LEADEN MISSILE HAVE MADE ITS WAY
6836-61804-0006 THE GIFT OF HER WHO ALONE COULD HAVE SECURED IT SUCH A PLACE TURNED ASIDE THE SHOT CAUSING IT TO RICOCHET NOT HARMLESSLY HOWEVER
6836-61804-0007 WITH THE MENTAL AND CORPOREAL EXCITEMENT LONG SUSTAINED DID NOT FAIL TO PRODUCE ITS EFFECT AND THE MIND OF MAURICE GERALD ONCE MORE RETURNED TO ITS DELIRIOUS DREAMING
6836-61804-0008 BUT NO LONGER LAY HIS BODY IN DANGER IN THE CHAPPARAL SURROUNDED BY WOLVES AND SHADOWED BY SOARING VULTURES IN A HUT WHERE HE WAS BUT ILL ATTENDED
6836-61804-0009 IN A JAIL WHERE HE WAS SCARCE CARED FOR AT ALL WHEN AGAIN RESTORED TO CONSCIOUSNESS IT WAS TO DISCOVER THAT THE FAIR VISION OF HIS DREAMS WAS NO VISION AT ALL BUT A LOVELY WOMAN
6836-61804-0010 THE SPIRIT OF THE ARISTOCRATIC PLANTER STEEPED IN SORROW AND HUMILIATED BY MISFORTUNE HAD BECOME PURGED OF ITS FALSE PRIDE THOUGH IT NEEDED NOT THIS TO MAKE HIM WILLINGLY ACQUIESCE IN AN ALLIANCE
6836-61804-0011 WHICH INSTEAD OF A NOBODY GAVE HIM A NOBLEMAN FOR HIS SON SUCH IN REALITY WAS SIR MAURICE GERALD ERST KNOWN AS MAURICE THE MUSTANGER IN TEXAS
6836-61804-0012 THE TITLE WOULD HAVE COUNTED FOR LITTLE NOR DID ITS OWNER CARE TO CARRY IT BUT BY A BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE NOT ALWAYS ATTENDANT ON AN IRISH BARONETCY
6836-61804-0013 IT CARRIED ALONG WITH IT AN ENDOWMENT AMPLE ENOUGH TO CLEAR CASA DEL CORVO OF THE MORTGAGE HELD BY THE LATE CASSIUS CALHOUN AND CLAIMED BY HIS NEAREST OF KIN THIS WAS NOT WOODLEY POINDEXTER
6836-61804-0014 FOR AFTER CALHOUN'S DEATH IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE EX CAPTAIN HAD ONCE BEEN A BENEDICT AND THERE WAS A YOUNG SCION OF HIS STOCK LIVING IN NEW ORLEANS WHO HAD THE LEGAL RIGHT TO SAY HE WAS HIS SON
6836-61804-0015 IT MATTERED NOT TO MAURICE GERALD WHO NOW CLEAR OF EVERY ENTANGLEMENT BECAME THE HUSBAND OF THE FAIR CREOLE AFTER A VISIT TO HIS NATIVE LAND INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN TOUR
6836-61804-0016 LOUISE POINDEXTER LADY GERALD SHE MUST NOW BE CALLED DURING HER SOJOURN IN THE EMERALD ISLE SAW NOTHING TO EXCITE HER TO JEALOUSY ONLY ONCE AGAIN DID THIS FELL PASSION
6836-61804-0017 TAKE POSSESSION OF HER SPIRIT AND THEN ONLY IN THE SHAPE OF A SHADOW SOON TO PASS AWAY IT WAS ONE DAY WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME HOME TO THE HACIENDA BEARING IN HIS ARMS THE BODY OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
6836-61804-0018 NOT YET DEAD THOUGH THE BLOOD STREAMING FROM A WOUND IN HER BARED BOSOM SHOWED SHE HAD NOT LONG TO LIVE TO THE QUESTION WHO HAS DONE THIS SHE WAS ONLY ABLE TO ANSWER DIAZ
6836-61804-0019 DIAZ IT WAS THE LAST UTTERANCE OF
6836-61804-0020 COVARUBIO DE LOS LLANOS AS THE SPIRIT OF THE UNHAPPY SENORITA PASSED INTO ETERNITY
6836-61804-0021 WHOSE STORY SHE NOW BETTER COMPREHENDED SHE EVEN ASSISTED HER LORD IN THE SADDLING OF HIS RED BAY STEED AND ENCOURAGED HIM IN THE PURSUIT OF THE ASSASSIN
6836-61804-0022 SHE JOYED TO SEE THE LATTER LED BACK AT THE END OF A LAZO HELD IN THE HAND OF HER HUSBAND AND REFUSED TO INTERFERE WHEN A BAND OF REGULATORS CALLED HASTILY TOGETHER
6836-61804-0023 DEALT OUT SUMMARY CHASTISEMENT BY HANGING HIM TO A TREE IT WAS NOT CRUELTY ONLY A CRUDE KIND OF JUSTICE AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH
6836-61804-0024 AND WHAT A POOR COMPENSATION IT SEEMED TO THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN EXACTING IT AS THEY STOOD GAZING UPON THE REMAINS OF THE VILLAIN AND HIS VICTIM THE SWARTH RUFFIAN DANGLING FROM THE BRANCH ABOVE
6836-61804-0025 AND THE FAIR FORM LYING UNDERNEATH THE HEARTS OF THE TEXANS WERE TOUCHED AS PERHAPS THEY HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE THERE WAS A STRANGE THOUGHT PASSING THROUGH THEIR MINDS
6836-61804-0026 A SADNESS INDEPENDENT OF THAT CAUSED BY THE SPECTACLE OF A MURDER IT WAS REGRET AT HAVING SO HASTILY DESPATCHED THE ASSASSIN BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN DEATH WAS ISIDORA SUCH FEATURES AS SHE POSSESSED
6836-61804-0027 AT LENGTH GOING WITH THOUGHTS NOT ALTOGETHER SACRED IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD TIME IS ACCOUNTED THE DESTROYER THOUGH IN THE MORAL IT IS OFT THE RESTORER
6836-61804-0028 NOWHERE HAS IT EFFECTED GREATER CHANGES THAN IN TEXAS DURING THE LAST DECADE AND ESPECIALLY
6836-61804-0029 PLANTATIONS HAVE SPRUNG UP WHERE LATE THE CHAPPARAL THICKLY COVERED THE EARTH AND CITIES STAND WHERE THE WILD STEED ONCE ROAMED OVER A PATHLESS PRAIRIE
6836-61804-0030 YOU WOULD BECOME THE RECIPIENT OF A HOSPITALITY UNEQUALLED IN EUROPEAN LANDS YOU WOULD HAVE FOR YOUR HOST ONE OF THE HANDSOMEST MEN IN TEXAS FOR YOUR HOSTESS ONE OF ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
6836-61804-0031 BOTH STILL THIS SIDE OF MIDDLE LIFE RESIDING UNDER THEIR ROOF YOU WOULD FIND AN OLD GENTLEMAN OF ARISTOCRATIC AIR AND VENERABLE ASPECT WITHAL CHATTY AND CHEERFUL WHO WOULD CONDUCT YOU AROUND THE CORRALES
6836-61804-0032 SHOW YOU THE STOCK AND NEVER TIRE OF TALKING ABOUT THE HUNDREDS AY THOUSANDS OF HORSES AND HORNED CATTLE SEEN ROAMING OVER THE PASTURES OF THE PLANTATION
6836-61804-0033 LEAVING HIM FOR A TIME YOU WOULD COME IN CONTACT WITH TWO OTHER INDIVIDUALS ATTACHED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT ONE IS THE GROOM OF THE STOLE BY NAME PHELIM O'NEAL
6836-61804-0034 WHO HAS FULL CHARGE OF THE HORSES THE OTHER A COACHMAN OF SABLE SKIN YCLEPT PLUTO POINDEXTER WHO WOULD SCORN TO LOOK AT A HORSE EXCEPT WHEN PERCHED UPON THE BOX
6836-61804-0035 AND AFTER HAVING THE RIBBONS DEFTLY DELIVERED INTO HIS HANDS SINCE WE LAST SAW HIM THE GAY PLUTO HAS BECOME TAMED DOWN TO A STAID AND SOBER BENEDICT BLACK THOUGH HE BE
6836-61804-0036 FLORINDA NOW THE BETTER HALF OF HIS LIFE HAS EFFECTED THE TRANSFORMATION
6836-61804-0037 AND BACK ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE RETIRED BUT THE HUGE GOBBLER SEEN IN THE SMOKE HOUSE
6836-61804-0038 THE DOMESTICS WILL TELL IT YOU BUT ONLY IN WHISPERS SINCE THEY KNOW THAT IT IS A THEME TABOOED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE MANSION IN WHOM IT EXCITES SAD SOUVENIRS IT IS THE STORY
6836-76549-0000 AT LA PORTE THE ROADS IMPROVE FOR SOME DISTANCE BUT ONCE AGAIN I AM BENIGHTED AND SLEEP UNDER A WHEAT SHOCK TRAVERSING SEVERAL MILES OF CORDUROY ROAD THROUGH HUCKLEBERRY SWAMPS NEXT MORNING I REACH CRAM'S POINT FOR BREAKFAST
6836-76549-0001 A REMNANT OF SOME INDIAN TRIBE STILL LINGERS AROUND HERE AND GATHERS HUCKLEBERRIES FOR THE MARKET TWO SQUAWS BEING IN THE VILLAGE PURCHASING SUPPLIES FOR THEIR CAMP IN THE SWAMPS WHAT'S THE NAME OF THESE INDIANS HERE I ASK
6836-76549-0002 SPLENDID GRAVEL ROADS LEAD FROM CRUM'S POINT TO SOUTH BEND AND ON THROUGH MISHAWAKA ALTERNATING WITH SANDY STRETCHES TO GOSHEN WHICH TOWN IS SAID BY THE GOSHENITES TO BE THE PRETTIEST IN INDIANA
6836-76549-0003 BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE CONSIDERABLE PRIDE OF LOCALITY IN THE GREAT HOOSIER STATE AND I VENTURE THERE ARE SCORES OF PRETTIEST TOWNS IN INDIANA NEVERTHELESS GOSHEN IS CERTAINLY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE WITH UNUSUALLY BROAD WELL SHADED STREETS
6836-76549-0004 HAS HAD AN EXTRA STOUT BONE SHAKER MADE TO ORDER
6836-76549-0005 WHO BEING ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT LESS BULKY RIDE REGULATION WHEELS JUMBO GOES ALL RIGHT WHEN MOUNTED BUT BEING UNABLE TO MOUNT WITHOUT AID HE SELDOM VENTURES ABROAD BY HIMSELF FOR FEAR OF HAVING TO FOOT IT BACK
6836-76549-0006 IS SO DELIGHTFULLY ROMANTIC AT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING JULY SEVENTEENTH I BOWL ACROSS THE BOUNDARY LINE INTO OHIO FOLLOWING THE MERCHANTS AND BANKERS TELEGRAPH ROAD TO NAPOLEON I PASS THROUGH A DISTRICT WHERE THE RAIN HAS OVERLOOKED THEM FOR TWO MONTHS
6836-76549-0007 IS HALF BURIED IN HOT DUST THE BLACKBERRIES ARE DEAD ON THE BUSHES AND THE LONG SUFFERING CORN LOOKS AS THOUGH AFFLICTED WITH THE YELLOW JAUNDICE
6836-76549-0008 AND SCARCELY KNOW A WORD OF ENGLISH YET A FAT PHLEGMATIC LOOKING BABY IS PEACEFULLY REPOSING IN A CRADLE WHICH IS SIMPLY HALF A MONSTER PUMPKIN SCOOPED OUT AND DRIED IT IS THE MOST INTENSELY RUSTIC CRADLE IN THE WORLD
6836-76549-0009 SURELY THIS YOUNGSTER'S HEAD OUGHT TO BE LEVEL ON AGRICULTURAL AFFAIRS WHEN HE GROWS UP IF ANYBODY'S OUGHT FROM NAPOLEON MY ROUTE LEADS UP THE MAUMEE RIVER AND CANAL FIRST TRYING THE TOW PATH OF THE LATTER AND THEN RELINQUISHING IT FOR
6836-76549-0010 THE VERY FAIR WAGON ROAD THE MAUMEE RIVER WINDING THROUGH ITS SPLENDID RICH VALLEY SEEMS TO POSSESS A PECULIAR BEAUTY ALL ITS OWN AND MY MIND UNBIDDEN MENTALLY COMPARES IT WITH OUR OLD FRIEND THE HUMBOLDT
6836-76549-0011 THE LATTER STREAM TRAVERSES DREARY PLAINS WHERE ALMOST NOTHING BUT SAGEBRUSH GROWS THE MAUMEE WATERS A SMILING VALLEY WHERE ORCHARDS FIELDS AND MEADOWS ALTERNATE WITH SUGAR MAPLE GROVES
6836-76549-0012 AND IN ITS FAIR BOSOM REFLECTS BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE VIEWS THAT ARE CHANGED AND REBEAUTIFIED BY THE MASTER HAND OF THE SUN EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY AND DOUBLY EMBELLISHED AT NIGHT BY THE MOON IT IS WHISPERED THAT DURING THE LATE UNPLEASANTNESS
6836-76549-0013 THE OHIO REGIMENTS COULD OUT YELL THE LOUISIANA TIGERS OR ANY OTHER CONFEDERATE TROOPS TWO TO ONE WHO HAS NOT HEARD THE OHIO YELL MOST PEOPLE ARE MAGNANIMOUSLY INCLINED TO REGARD THIS RUMOR AS SIMPLY A GAG ON THE BUCKEYE BOYS
6836-76549-0014 BUT IT ISN'T THE OHIOANS ARE TO THE MANNER BORN THE BUCKEYE YELL IS A TANGIBLE FACT ALL ALONG THE MAUMEE IT RESOUNDS IN MY EARS NEARLY EVERY MAN OR BOY WHO FROM THE FIELDS FAR OR NEAR
