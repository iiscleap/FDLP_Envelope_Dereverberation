3168-173564-0029 THRUST OUT FROM UNDER THE QUILT WAS GROWING COLD ON THE BARE FLOOR AS IF TO CELEBRATE A VICTORY OVER EVERYBODY A CRICKET CHIRPED IN A CRACK IN THE WALL A COCK CROWED FAR OFF AND ANOTHER REPLIED NEAR BY
3168-173564-0030 THE SHOUTING IN THE TAVERN HAD DIED DOWN ONLY THE MOANING OF THE ADJUTANT WAS HEARD NATASHA SAT UP SONYA ARE YOU ASLEEP MAMMA SHE WHISPERED
3168-173564-0031 NO ONE REPLIED NATASHA ROSE SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY CROSSED HERSELF AND STEPPED CAUTIOUSLY ON THE COLD AND DIRTY FLOOR WITH HER SLIM SUPPLE BARE FEET THE BOARDS OF THE FLOOR CREAKED
3168-173564-0032 STEPPING CAUTIOUSLY FROM ONE FOOT TO THE OTHER SHE RAN LIKE A KITTEN THE FEW STEPS TO THE DOOR AND GRASPED THE COLD DOOR HANDLE IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SOMETHING HEAVY WAS BEATING RHYTHMICALLY AGAINST ALL THE WALLS OF THE ROOM
3168-173564-0033 IT WAS HER OWN HEART SINKING WITH ALARM AND TERROR AND OVERFLOWING WITH LOVE SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND STEPPED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD AND ONTO THE COLD DAMP EARTHEN FLOOR OF THE PASSAGE THE COLD SHE FELT REFRESHED HER
3168-173564-0034 WITH HER BARE FEET SHE TOUCHED A SLEEPING MAN STEPPED OVER HIM AND OPENED THE DOOR INTO THE PART OF THE HUT WHERE PRINCE ANDREW LAY IT WAS DARK IN THERE IN THE FARTHEST CORNER ON A BENCH BESIDE A BED
3168-173564-0035 ON WHICH SOMETHING WAS LYING STOOD A TALLOW CANDLE WITH A LONG THICK AND SMOLDERING WICK FROM THE MOMENT SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT MORNING OF PRINCE ANDREW'S WOUND AND HIS PRESENCE THERE NATASHA HAD RESOLVED TO SEE HIM
3168-173564-0036 SHE DID NOT KNOW WHY SHE HAD TO SHE KNEW THE MEETING WOULD BE PAINFUL
3168-173564-0037 ALL DAY SHE HAD LIVED ONLY IN HOPE OF SEEING HIM THAT NIGHT BUT NOW THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME SHE WAS FILLED WITH DREAD OF WHAT SHE MIGHT SEE HOW WAS HE MAIMED WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIM
3168-173564-0038 WAS HE LIKE THAT INCESSANT MOANING OF THE ADJUTANT'S YES HE WAS ALTOGETHER LIKE THAT IN HER IMAGINATION HE WAS THAT TERRIBLE MOANING PERSONIFIED WHEN SHE SAW AN INDISTINCT SHAPE IN THE CORNER AND MISTOOK HIS KNEES
3168-173564-0039 RAISED UNDER THE QUILT FOR HIS SHOULDERS SHE IMAGINED A HORRIBLE BODY THERE AND STOOD STILL IN TERROR BUT AN IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE DREW HER FORWARD SHE CAUTIOUSLY TOOK ONE STEP AND THEN ANOTHER
3168-173564-0040 AND FOUND HERSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A SMALL ROOM CONTAINING BAGGAGE ANOTHER MAN TIMOKHIN WAS LYING IN A CORNER ON THE BENCHES BENEATH THE ICONS AND TWO OTHERS THE DOCTOR AND A VALET LAY ON THE FLOOR
3168-173564-0041 THE VALET SAT UP AND WHISPERED SOMETHING TIMOKHIN KEPT AWAKE BY THE PAIN IN HIS WOUNDED LEG GAZED WITH WIDE OPEN EYES AT THIS STRANGE APPARITION OF A GIRL IN A WHITE
3168-173564-0042 DRESSING JACKET AND NIGHTCAP THE VALET'S SLEEPY FRIGHTENED EXCLAMATION
3168-173564-0043 HORRIBLY UNLIKE A MAN AS THAT BODY LOOKED SHE MUST SEE HIM SHE PASSED THE VALET THE SNUFF FELL FROM THE CANDLE WICK AND SHE SAW PRINCE ANDREW CLEARLY WITH HIS ARMS OUTSIDE THE QUILT
3168-173564-0044 AND SUCH AS SHE HAD ALWAYS SEEN HIM HE WAS THE SAME AS EVER BUT THE FEVERISH COLOR OF HIS FACE HIS GLITTERING EYES RAPTUROUSLY TURNED TOWARD HER AND ESPECIALLY HIS NECK DELICATE AS A CHILD'S
3168-173564-0045 REVEALED BY THE TURN DOWN COLLAR OF HIS SHIRT GAVE HIM A PECULIARLY INNOCENT CHILDLIKE LOOK SUCH AS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ON HIM BEFORE SHE WENT UP TO HIM AND WITH A SWIFT FLEXIBLE YOUTHFUL MOVEMENT DROPPED ON HER KNEES
3168-173565-0000 SEVEN DAYS HAD PASSED SINCE PRINCE ANDREW FOUND HIMSELF IN THE AMBULANCE STATION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO HIS FEVERISH STATE AND THE INFLAMMATION OF HIS BOWELS WHICH WERE INJURED
3168-173565-0001 WERE IN THE DOCTOR'S OPINION SURE TO CARRY HIM OFF BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE ATE WITH PLEASURE A PIECE OF BREAD WITH SOME TEA AND THE DOCTOR NOTICED THAT HIS TEMPERATURE WAS LOWER HE HAD REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS THAT MORNING THE FIRST NIGHT AFTER THEY LEFT MOSCOW
3168-173565-0002 HAD BEEN FAIRLY WARM AND HE HAD REMAINED IN THE CALECHE BUT AT MYTISHCHI THE WOUNDED MAN HIMSELF ASKED TO BE TAKEN OUT AND GIVEN SOME TEA THE PAIN CAUSED BY HIS REMOVAL INTO THE HUT HAD MADE HIM GROAN ALOUD AND AGAIN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS
3168-173565-0003 WHEN HE HAD BEEN PLACED ON HIS CAMP BED HE LAY FOR A LONG TIME MOTIONLESS WITH CLOSED EYES THEN HE OPENED THEM AND WHISPERED SOFTLY AND THE TEA HIS REMEMBERING SUCH A SMALL DETAIL OF EVERYDAY LIFE ASTONISHED THE DOCTOR
3168-173565-0004 HE FELT PRINCE ANDREW'S PULSE AND TO HIS SURPRISE AND DISSATISFACTION FOUND IT HAD IMPROVED HE WAS DISSATISFIED BECAUSE HE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT IF HIS PATIENT DID NOT DIE NOW HE WOULD DO SO A LITTLE LATER WITH GREATER SUFFERING
3168-173565-0005 TIMOKHIN THE RED NOSED MAJOR OF PRINCE ANDREW'S REGIMENT HAD JOINED HIM IN MOSCOW AND WAS BEING TAKEN ALONG WITH HIM HAVING BEEN WOUNDED IN THE LEG AT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A DOCTOR
3168-173565-0006 PRINCE ANDREW'S VALET HIS COACHMAN AND TWO ORDERLIES THEY GAVE PRINCE ANDREW SOME TEA HE DRANK IT EAGERLY LOOKING WITH FEVERISH EYES AT THE DOOR IN FRONT OF HIM AS IF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND REMEMBER SOMETHING
3168-173565-0007 I DON'T WANT ANY MORE IS TIMOKHIN HERE HE ASKED TIMOKHIN CREPT ALONG THE BENCH TO HIM I AM HERE YOUR EXCELLENCY HOW'S YOUR WOUND MINE SIR
3168-173565-0008 PRINCE ANDREW AGAIN PONDERED AS IF TRYING TO REMEMBER SOMETHING COULDN'T ONE GET A BOOK HE ASKED WHAT BOOK THE GOSPELS I HAVEN'T ONE
3168-173565-0009 THE DOCTOR PROMISED TO PROCURE IT FOR HIM AND BEGAN TO ASK HOW HE WAS FEELING PRINCE ANDREW ANSWERED ALL HIS QUESTIONS RELUCTANTLY BUT REASONABLY
3168-173565-0010 AND THEN SAID HE WANTED A BOLSTER PLACED UNDER HIM AS HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND IN GREAT PAIN THE DOCTOR AND VALET LIFTED THE CLOAK WITH WHICH HE WAS COVERED AND MAKING WRY FACES AT THE NOISOME SMELL OF MORTIFYING FLESH
3168-173565-0011 THAT CAME FROM THE WOUND BEGAN EXAMINING THAT DREADFUL PLACE THE DOCTOR WAS VERY MUCH DISPLEASED ABOUT SOMETHING AND MADE A CHANGE IN THE DRESSINGS TURNING THE WOUNDED MAN OVER SO THAT HE GROANED AGAIN AND GREW UNCONSCIOUS AND DELIRIOUS FROM THE AGONY
3168-173565-0012 HE KEPT ASKING THEM TO GET HIM THE BOOK AND PUT IT UNDER HIM WHAT TROUBLE WOULD IT BE TO YOU HE SAID
3168-173565-0013 HE PLEADED IN A PITEOUS VOICE THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE PASSAGE TO WASH HIS HANDS YOU FELLOWS HAVE NO CONSCIENCE SAID HE TO THE VALET WHO WAS POURING WATER OVER HIS HANDS
3168-173565-0014 THAT I WONDER HOW HE CAN BEAR IT BY THE LORD JESUS CHRIST I THOUGHT WE HAD PUT SOMETHING UNDER HIM SAID THE VALET THE FIRST TIME PRINCE ANDREW UNDERSTOOD WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM AND REMEMBERED BEING WOUNDED AND HOW
3168-173565-0015 WAS WHEN HE ASKED TO BE CARRIED INTO THE HUT AFTER HIS CALECHE HAD STOPPED AT MYTISHCHI AFTER GROWING CONFUSED FROM PAIN WHILE BEING CARRIED INTO THE HUT HE AGAIN REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHILE DRINKING TEA ONCE MORE RECALLED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
3168-173565-0016 AND ABOVE ALL VIVIDLY REMEMBERED THE MOMENT AT THE AMBULANCE STATION WHEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE SUFFERINGS OF A MAN HE DISLIKED THOSE NEW THOUGHTS HAD COME TO HIM WHICH PROMISED HIM HAPPINESS AND THOSE
3168-173565-0017 THOUGHTS THOUGH NOW VAGUE AND INDEFINITE AGAIN POSSESSED HIS SOUL HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD NOW A NEW SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND THAT THIS HAPPINESS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE GOSPELS THAT WAS WHY HE ASKED FOR A COPY OF THEM
3168-173565-0018 THE UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION IN WHICH THEY HAD PUT HIM AND TURNED HIM OVER AGAIN CONFUSED HIS THOUGHTS AND WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF A THIRD TIME IT WAS IN THE COMPLETE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT EVERYBODY NEAR HIM WAS SLEEPING A CRICKET CHIRPED FROM ACROSS THE PASSAGE
3168-173565-0019 SOMEONE WAS SHOUTING AND SINGING IN THE STREET COCKROACHES RUSTLED ON THE TABLE ON THE ICONS AND ON THE WALLS AND A BIG FLY FLOPPED AT THE HEAD OF THE BED AND AROUND THE CANDLE BESIDE HIM THE WICK OF WHICH WAS CHARRED AND HAD SHAPED ITSELF LIKE A MUSHROOM
3168-173565-0020 HIS MIND WAS NOT IN A NORMAL STATE A HEALTHY MAN USUALLY THINKS OF FEELS AND REMEMBERS INNUMERABLE THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT HAS THE POWER AND WILL TO SELECT ONE SEQUENCE OF THOUGHTS OR EVENTS ON WHICH TO FIX HIS WHOLE ATTENTION
3168-173565-0021 A HEALTHY MAN CAN TEAR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE DEEPEST REFLECTIONS TO SAY A CIVIL WORD TO SOMEONE WHO COMES IN AND CAN THEN RETURN AGAIN TO HIS OWN THOUGHTS
3168-173565-0022 ALL THE POWERS OF HIS MIND WERE MORE ACTIVE AND CLEARER THAN EVER BUT THEY ACTED APART FROM HIS WILL MOST DIVERSE THOUGHTS AND IMAGES OCCUPIED HIM SIMULTANEOUSLY AT TIMES HIS BRAIN SUDDENLY BEGAN TO WORK WITH A VIGOR CLEARNESS AND DEPTH
3168-173565-0023 IT HAD NEVER REACHED WHEN HE WAS IN HEALTH BUT SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF ITS WORK IT WOULD TURN TO SOME UNEXPECTED IDEA AND HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO TURN IT BACK AGAIN YES A NEW HAPPINESS WAS REVEALED TO ME OF WHICH MAN CANNOT BE DEPRIVED
3168-173565-0024 HE THOUGHT AS HE LAY IN THE SEMIDARKNESS OF THE QUIET HUT GAZING FIXEDLY BEFORE HIM WITH FEVERISH WIDE OPEN EYES A HAPPINESS LYING BEYOND MATERIAL FORCES OUTSIDE THE MATERIAL INFLUENCES THAT ACT ON MAN
3168-173565-0025 EVERY MAN CAN UNDERSTAND IT BUT TO CONCEIVE IT AND ENJOIN IT WAS POSSIBLE ONLY FOR GOD BUT HOW DID GOD ENJOIN THAT LAW AND WHY WAS THE SON AND SUDDENLY THE SEQUENCE OF THESE THOUGHTS BROKE OFF
3168-173565-0026 AND PRINCE ANDREW HEARD WITHOUT KNOWING WHETHER IT WAS A DELUSION OR REALITY A SOFT WHISPERING VOICE INCESSANTLY AND RHYTHMICALLY REPEATING PITI PITI PITI AND THEN
3168-173565-0027 AND TI TI ONCE MORE AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THAT ABOVE HIS FACE ABOVE THE VERY MIDDLE OF IT SOME STRANGE AIRY STRUCTURE WAS BEING ERECTED OUT OF SLENDER NEEDLES OR SPLINTERS
3168-173565-0028 TO THE SOUND OF THIS WHISPERED MUSIC HE FELT THAT HE HAD TO BALANCE CAREFULLY THOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT SO THAT THIS AIRY STRUCTURE SHOULD NOT COLLAPSE BUT NEVERTHELESS IT KEPT COLLAPSING AND AGAIN SLOWLY RISING TO THE SOUND OF
3168-173565-0029 WHISPERED RHYTHMIC MUSIC IT STRETCHES STRETCHES SPREADING OUT AND STRETCHING SAID PRINCE ANDREW TO HIMSELF WHILE LISTENING TO THIS WHISPERING AND FEELING THE SENSATION OF THIS DRAWING OUT AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS EDIFICE OF NEEDLES
3168-173565-0030 HE ALSO SAW BY GLIMPSES A RED HALO ROUND THE CANDLE AND HEARD THE RUSTLE OF THE COCKROACHES AND THE BUZZING OF THE FLY THAT FLOPPED AGAINST HIS PILLOW AND HIS FACE
3168-173565-0031 EACH TIME THE FLY TOUCHED HIS FACE IT GAVE HIM A BURNING SENSATION AND YET TO HIS SURPRISE IT DID NOT DESTROY THE STRUCTURE THOUGH IT KNOCKED AGAINST THE VERY REGION OF HIS FACE WHERE IT WAS RISING
3168-173565-0032 WHICH ALSO OPPRESSED HIM BUT PERHAPS THAT'S MY SHIRT ON THE TABLE HE THOUGHT AND THAT'S MY LEGS AND THAT IS THE DOOR BUT WHY IS IT ALWAYS STRETCHING AND DRAWING ITSELF OUT AND
3168-173565-0033 PITI PITI PITI AND TI TI AND PITI PITI PITI THAT'S ENOUGH PLEASE LEAVE OFF PRINCE ANDREW PAINFULLY ENTREATED SOMEONE AND SUDDENLY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AGAIN SWAM TO THE SURFACE OF HIS MIND WITH PECULIAR CLEARNESS AND FORCE
3168-173565-0034 FOR SOME PURPOSE OR FOR SOME REASON BUT THE LOVE WHICH I WHILE DYING FIRST EXPERIENCED WHEN I SAW MY ENEMY AND YET LOVED HIM I EXPERIENCED THAT FEELING OF LOVE WHICH IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL AND DOES NOT REQUIRE AN OBJECT
3168-173565-0035 NOW AGAIN I FEEL THAT BLISS TO LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBORS
3168-173565-0036 BUT AN ENEMY CAN ONLY BE LOVED BY DIVINE LOVE
3168-173565-0037 IS HE ALIVE WHEN LOVING WITH HUMAN LOVE ONE MAY PASS FROM LOVE TO HATRED BUT DIVINE LOVE CANNOT CHANGE NO NEITHER DEATH NOR ANYTHING ELSE CAN DESTROY IT IT IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
3168-173565-0038 YET HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE I HATED IN MY LIFE AND OF THEM ALL I LOVED AND HATED NONE AS I DID HER
3168-173565-0039 NOT AS HE HAD DONE IN THE PAST WITH NOTHING BUT HER CHARMS WHICH GAVE HIM DELIGHT BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME PICTURING TO HIMSELF HER SOUL AND HE UNDERSTOOD HER FEELINGS HER SUFFERINGS SHAME AND REMORSE
3168-173565-0040 IF ONLY IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SEE HER ONCE MORE JUST ONCE LOOKING INTO THOSE EYES TO SAY PITI PITI PITI AND
3168-173565-0041 TI TI AND PITI PITI PITI BOOM FLOPPED THE FLY AND HIS ATTENTION WAS SUDDENLY CARRIED INTO ANOTHER WORLD
3168-173565-0042 AND DELIRIUM IN WHICH SOMETHING PARTICULAR WAS HAPPENING IN THAT WORLD SOME STRUCTURE WAS STILL BEING ERECTED AND DID NOT FALL SOMETHING WAS STILL STRETCHING OUT AND THE CANDLE WITH ITS RED HALO WAS STILL BURNING
3168-173565-0043 BUT BESIDES ALL THIS SOMETHING CREAKED THERE WAS A WHIFF OF FRESH AIR AND A NEW WHITE SPHINX APPEARED STANDING AT THE DOOR AND THAT SPHINX HAD THE PALE FACE AND SHINING EYES OF THE VERY NATASHA OF WHOM HE HAD JUST BEEN THINKING
3168-173565-0044 OH HOW OPPRESSIVE THIS CONTINUAL DELIRIUM IS THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW TRYING TO DRIVE THAT FACE FROM HIS IMAGINATION BUT THE FACE REMAINED BEFORE HIM WITH THE FORCE OF REALITY AND DREW NEARER
3168-173565-0045 BUT HE COULD NOT AND DELIRIUM DREW HIM BACK INTO ITS DOMAIN THE SOFT WHISPERING VOICE CONTINUED ITS RHYTHMIC MURMUR SOMETHING OPPRESSED HIM AND STRETCHED OUT AND THE STRANGE FACE WAS BEFORE HIM
3168-173565-0046 HE MOVED A LITTLE AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A RINGING IN HIS EARS
3168-173565-0047 WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF NATASHA THAT SAME LIVING NATASHA WHOM OF ALL PEOPLE HE MOST LONGED TO LOVE WITH THIS NEW PURE DIVINE LOVE THAT HAD BEEN REVEALED TO HIM WAS KNEELING BEFORE HIM
3168-173565-0048 HE REALIZED THAT IT WAS THE REAL LIVING NATASHA AND HE WAS NOT SURPRISED BUT QUIETLY HAPPY NATASHA MOTIONLESS ON HER KNEES SHE WAS UNABLE TO STIR
3168-173565-0049 WITH FRIGHTENED EYES RIVETED ON HIM WAS RESTRAINING HER SOBS HER FACE WAS PALE AND RIGID ONLY IN THE LOWER PART OF IT SOMETHING QUIVERED PRINCE ANDREW SIGHED WITH RELIEF SMILED
3168-173565-0050 AND HELD OUT HIS HAND YOU HE SAID HOW FORTUNATE WITH A RAPID BUT CAREFUL MOVEMENT NATASHA DREW NEARER TO HIM ON HER KNEES AND TAKING HIS HAND CAREFULLY
3168-173565-0051 JUST TOUCHING IT LIGHTLY WITH HER LIPS FORGIVE ME SHE WHISPERED RAISING HER HEAD AND GLANCING AT HIM FORGIVE ME I LOVE YOU SAID PRINCE ANDREW
3168-173565-0052 FORGIVE WHAT HE ASKED
3168-173565-0053 BROKEN WHISPER AND BEGAN KISSING HIS HAND MORE RAPIDLY JUST TOUCHING IT WITH HER LIPS I LOVE YOU MORE BETTER THAN BEFORE SAID PRINCE ANDREW LIFTING HER FACE WITH HIS HAND
3168-173565-0054 SO AS TO LOOK INTO HER EYES THOSE EYES FILLED WITH HAPPY TEARS GAZED AT HIM TIMIDLY COMPASSIONATELY AND WITH JOYOUS LOVE NATASHA'S THIN PALE FACE WITH ITS SWOLLEN LIPS
3168-173565-0055 WAS MORE THAN PLAIN IT WAS DREADFUL BUT PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE THAT HE SAW HER SHINING EYES WHICH WERE BEAUTIFUL THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES BEHIND THEM PETER THE VALET WHO WAS NOW WIDE AWAKE HAD ROUSED THE DOCTOR
3168-173565-0056 TIMOKHIN WHO HAD NOT SLEPT AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE PAIN IN HIS LEG HAD LONG BEEN WATCHING ALL THAT WAS GOING ON CAREFULLY COVERING HIS BARE BODY WITH THE SHEET AS HE HUDDLED UP ON HIS BENCH WHAT'S THIS SAID THE DOCTOR RISING FROM HIS BED
3168-173565-0057 PLEASE GO AWAY MADAM AT THAT MOMENT A MAID SENT BY THE COUNTESS WHO HAD NOTICED HER DAUGHTER'S ABSENCE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR LIKE A SOMNAMBULIST
3168-173565-0058 FELL SOBBING ON HER BED FROM THAT TIME DURING ALL THE REST OF THE ROSTOVS JOURNEY AT EVERY HALTING PLACE AND WHEREVER THEY SPENT A NIGHT NATASHA NEVER LEFT THE WOUNDED BOLKONSKI
3168-173565-0059 AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO ADMIT THAT HE HAD NOT EXPECTED FROM A YOUNG GIRL EITHER SUCH FIRMNESS OR SUCH SKILL IN NURSING A WOUNDED MAN DREADFUL AS THE COUNTESS IMAGINED IT WOULD BE SHOULD PRINCE ANDREW DIE IN HER DAUGHTER'S ARMS DURING THE JOURNEY
3168-173565-0060 AS JUDGING BY WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID IT SEEMED MIGHT EASILY HAPPEN SHE COULD NOT OPPOSE NATASHA THOUGH WITH THE INTIMACY NOW ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE WOUNDED MAN AND NATASHA THE THOUGHT OCCURRED THAT SHOULD HE RECOVER THEIR FORMER ENGAGEMENT WOULD BE RENEWED
3168-173565-0061 NO ONE LEAST OF ALL NATASHA AND PRINCE ANDREW SPOKE OF THIS THE UNSETTLED QUESTION OF LIFE AND DEATH WHICH HUNG NOT ONLY OVER BOLKONSKI BUT OVER ALL RUSSIA
32-21625-0000 WAS NOT THE ONLY VILLAGE TO BE SEEN FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN THERE WAS ANOTHER WHICH FARMER GREEN SELDOM VISITED BECAUSE IT LAY BEYOND THE MOUNTAIN AND WAS A LONG DISTANCE FROM HIS HOUSE THOUGH HE OWNED THE LAND WHERE IT STOOD
32-21625-0001 THOSE THAT LIVED THERE THOUGHT THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO STAY THERE AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED IT WAS IN THIS VILLAGE THAT BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS NEIGHBORS LIVED IT WAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF TOWN TOO
32-21625-0002 FROM THE ONE WHERE FARMER GREEN WENT EACH WEEK OVER BEYOND BLUE MOUNTAIN ALL THE HOUSES WERE BUILT IN A POND AND ALL THEIR DOORS WERE UNDER WATER BUT NOBODY MINDED THAT BECAUSE LIKE BROWNIE BEAVER
32-21625-0003 EVERYBODY THAT DWELT THERE WAS A FINE SWIMMER YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE BROWNIE'S TIME HIS FOREFATHERS HAD COME THERE AND FINDING THAT THERE WERE MANY TREES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE SORT OF BARK THEY LIKED TO EAT
32-21625-0004 SUCH AS POPLARS WILLOWS AND BOX ELDERS THEY HAD DECIDED THAT IT WAS A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE THERE WAS A SMALL STREAM TOO WHICH WAS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF SWIFT RIVER
32-21625-0005 AND BY DAMMING IT THOSE OLD SETTLERS MADE A POND IN WHICH THEY COULD BUILD THEIR HOUSES THEY HAD IDEAS OF THEIR OWN AS TO WHAT A HOUSE SHOULD BE LIKE
32-21625-0006 THOUGH YOU PERHAPS MIGHT NOT CARE FOR THEM AT ALL THEY WANTED THEIR HOUSES TO BE SURROUNDED BY WATER BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFER WHEN BUILT IN THAT MANNER AND THEY ALWAYS INSISTED THAT A DOOR LEADING INTO A HOUSE
32-21625-0007 SHOULD BE FAR BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT THAT MADE A HOUSE SAFER TOO TO YOU SUCH AN IDEA MAY SEEM VERY STRANGE BUT IF YOU WERE CHASED BY AN ENEMY YOU MIGHT BE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SWIM UNDER WATER
32-21625-0008 DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF A POND AND SLIP INSIDE A DOOR WHICH LED TO A WINDING HALL
32-21625-0009 OF COURSE YOUR ENEMY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SWIM AS WELL AS YOU BUT MAYBE HE WOULD THINK TWICE OR EVEN THREE TIMES BEFORE HE WENT PROWLING THROUGH YOUR CROOKED HALL FOR IF YOU HAD ENORMOUS STRONG SHARP TEETH
32-21625-0010 WITH WHICH YOU COULD GNAW RIGHT THROUGH A TREE HE WOULD NOT CARE TO HAVE YOU SEIZE HIM AS HE POKED HIS HEAD AROUND A CORNER IN A DARK PASSAGE OF A STRANGE HOUSE IT WAS IN A HOUSE OF THAT KIND THAT BROWNIE BEAVER LIVED
32-21625-0011 AND HE BUILT IT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAID HE WOULD RATHER HAVE A NEAT NEW HOUSE THAN ONE OF THE BIG OLD DWELLINGS THAT HAD BEEN BUILT MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD HELPED THROW THE DAM ACROSS THE STREAM THE DAM WAS THERE STILL
32-21625-0012 IT WAS SO OLD THAT TREES WERE GROWING ON IT AND THERE WAS AN ODD THING ABOUT IT IT WAS NEVER FINISHED THOUGH BROWNIE BEAVER WAS A YOUNG CHAP HE WORKED ON THE DAM SOMETIMES LIKE ALL HIS NEIGHBORS
32-21625-0013 YOU SEE THE VILLAGERS KEPT MAKING THE DAM WIDER AND SINCE IT WAS BUILT OF STICKS AND MUD THE WATER SOMETIMES WASHED BITS OF IT AWAY SO IT HAD TO BE KEPT IN REPAIR IF BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS FRIENDS HAD NEGLECTED THEIR DAM
32-21625-0014 AND WITHOUT ANY WATER TO HIDE THEIR DOORWAYS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE NO LONGER THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NO PLACE EITHER TO STORE THEIR WINTER'S FOOD FOR THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING DOWN TREES AND SAVING THE BARK AND BRANCHES TOO
32-21625-0015 IN ORDER TO HAVE PLENTY TO EAT WHEN COLD WEATHER CAME AND THE ICE CLOSED THEIR POND SOME OF THEIR FOOD THEY CARRIED INTO THEIR HOUSES THROUGH A STRAIGHT HALL WHICH WAS MADE FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE
32-21625-0016 AND SOME OF THE BRANCHES THEY FASTENED UNDER WATER NEAR THE DAM IT WAS JUST LIKE PUTTING GREEN THINGS INTO A REFRIGERATOR SO THEY WILL KEEP NOW YOU SEE WHY BROWNIE BEAVER WOULD NO MORE HAVE THOUGHT OF BUILDING HIS HOUSE ON DRY LAND
32-21625-0017 THAN YOU WOULD THINK OF BUILDING ONE IN A POND EVERYBODY LIKES HIS OWN WAY BEST AND IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO BROWNIE BEAVER THAT HIS WAY WAS THE LEAST BIT STRANGE
32-21631-0000 AFTER MISTER CROW FLEW BACK TO PLEASANT VALLEY TO GATHER NEWS FOR HIM BROWNIE BEAVER CAREFULLY COUNTED EACH DAY THAT PASSED SINCE MISTER CROW HAD AGREED TO BE HIS NEWSPAPER AND COME EACH SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO TELL HIM EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THE WEEK
32-21631-0001 BROWNIE WAS IN A GREAT HURRY FOR SATURDAY TO ARRIVE IN ORDER TO MAKE NO MISTAKE HE PUT ASIDE A STICK IN WHICH HE GNAWED A NOTCH EACH DAY AND IN THAT WAY HE KNEW EXACTLY WHEN SATURDAY CAME
32-21631-0002 THAT WAS PROBABLY THE LONGEST DAY IN BROWNIE BEAVER'S LIFE AT LEAST IT SEEMED SO TO HIM WHENEVER HE SAW A BIRD SOARING ABOVE THE TREE TOPS HE COULDN'T HELP HOPING IT WAS MISTER CROW
