7859-102519-0050 AFTER COMPELLING HIM TO TAKE HOLY ORDERS MEANWHILE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EMPIRE WAS VISIBLY BREAKING UP THE AFFAIRS BOTH OF THE REALM AND THE CITY WERE NEGLECTED AND DECAYING CIVIL EDUCATION WAS DISAPPEARING AND MILITARY DISCIPLINE DISSOLVED
7859-102519-0051 AND EVERY YEAR THEIR RAVAGES PENETRATED FURTHER INLAND
7859-102519-0052 WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF LAYING SIEGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE NO ONE HINDERED HIM FOR THE ARMY RAISED TO SERVE AGAINST HIM
7859-102519-0053 THEY HAD PENETRATED INTO PHRYGIA
7859-102519-0054 WITH EVERY EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS WHEN AT LAST THERE APPEARED THE MAN WHO WAS DESTINED TO SAVE THE EAST ROMAN EMPIRE FROM A PREMATURE DISMEMBERMENT
7859-102519-0055 WHO HAD MADE A GREAT REPUTATION AMID THE FEARFUL DISASTERS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS HE WAS NOW GENERAL OF THE ANATOLIC THEME THE PROVINCE WHICH INCLUDED THE OLD CAPPADOCIA AND LYCAONIA AFTER INDUCING THE SARACENS MORE BY CRAFT THAN FORCE
7859-102519-0056 TO RAISE THE SIEGE OF AMORIUM LEO DISOWNED HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE INCAPABLE THEODOSIUS AND MARCHED TOWARD THE BOSPHORUS THE UNFORTUNATE EMPEROR WHO HAD NOT COVETED THE THRONE HE OCCUPIED NOR MUCH DESIRED TO RETAIN IT
7859-102521-0000 THE ICONOCLASTS
7859-102521-0001 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL FOR HIS REPUTATION IN HISTORY UNHAPPILY FOR HIMSELF THOUGH HAPPILY ENOUGH FOR THE EAST ROMAN REALM HE SURVIVED YET TWENTY YEARS TO CARRY THROUGH A SERIES OF MEASURES WHICH WERE IN HIS EYES NOT LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE REPULSE OF THE MOSLEMS FROM HIS CAPITAL
7859-102521-0002 HISTORIANS HAVE GIVEN TO THE SCHEME OF REFORM WHICH HE TOOK IN HAND THE NAME OF THE ICONOCLASTIC MOVEMENT BECAUSE OF THE OPPOSITION TO THE WORSHIP OF IMAGES WHICH FORMED ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURES OF HIS ACTION
7859-102521-0003 FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THE EMPIRE HAD BEEN DECLINING IN CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION LITERATURE AND ART SEEMED LIKELY TO PERISH IN THE NEVER ENDING CLASH OF ARMS THE OLD ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE WAS BEING FORGOTTEN
7859-102521-0004 THE RACE OF EDUCATED CIVIL SERVANTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF EXTINCTION THE GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES WERE NOW WITHOUT EXCEPTION ROUGH SOLDIERS NOT MEMBERS OF THAT OLD BUREAUCRACY WHOSE ROMAN TRADITIONS HAD SO LONG KEPT THE EMPIRE TOGETHER
7859-102521-0005 NOT LEAST AMONG THE SIGNS OF A DECAYING CIVILIZATION WERE THE GROSS SUPERSTITIONS WHICH HAD GROWN UP OF LATE IN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD
7859-102521-0006 UNNOTICED AND UNGUARDED AGAINST BY THEOLOGIANS WHO DEVOTED ALL THEIR ENERGIES TO THE BARREN MONOTHELITE AND MONOPHYSITE CONTROVERSIES IMAGE WORSHIP AND RELIC WORSHIP IN PARTICULAR HAD DEVELOPED WITH STRANGE RAPIDITY AND ASSUMED THE SHAPE OF MERE FETISHISM
7859-102521-0007 SLAVS AND BULGARIANS ALL OF WHOM HE BEAT BACK WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ON THE NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WHEN THEY INVADED THE EMPIRE BUT IN THE MINDS BOTH OF CONSTANTINE HIMSELF AND OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HIS DEALINGS WITH THINGS RELIGIOUS WERE THE MAIN FEATURE OF HIS REIGN
7859-102521-0008 AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS BEGUN TO CLOSE MONASTERIES WHOLESALE WE ARE TOLD THAT HE COMPELLED MANY OF THEIR INMATES TO MARRY BY FORCE OF THREATS OTHERS WERE EXILED TO CYPRUS BY THE HUNDRED NOT A FEW WERE FLOGGED AND IMPRISONED
7859-102521-0009 THESE UNWISE MEASURES HAD THE NATURAL EFFECT THE MONKS WERE EVERYWHERE REGARDED AS MARTYRS AND THE IMAGE WORSHIP WHICH THEY SUPPORTED GREW MORE THAN EVER POPULAR WITH THE MASSES WHILE STILL IN THE FULL VIGOUR OF HIS PERSECUTING ENTHUSIASM
7859-102521-0010 WHILE THE EMPRESS DOWAGER IRENE BECAME SOLE REGENT AND HER NAME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF HER SON IN ALL ACTS OF STATE
7859-102521-0011 BUT IN HIS TWENTY SECOND YEAR HE REBELLED AGAINST HIS MOTHER'S DICTATION AND TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE HELM OF THE STATE IRENE HAD ACTUALLY STRIVEN TO OPPOSE HIM BY ARMED FORCE BUT HE PARDONED HER AND AFTER SECLUDING HER FOR A SHORT TIME
7859-102521-0012 RESTORED HER TO HER FORMER DIGNITY THE UNNATURAL MOTHER WAS FAR FROM ACQUIESCING IN HER SON'S ELEVATION
7859-102521-0013 SEIZED THE YOUNG EMPEROR BLINDED HIM AND IMMURED HIM IN A MONASTERY BEFORE ANY OF HIS ADHERENTS WERE ABLE TO COME TO HIS AID
7859-102521-0014 HER GRAND TREASURER HAVING GAINED OVER SOME OF THE EUNUCHS AND OTHER COURTIERS ABOUT HER PERSON
7859-102521-0015 THE ICONOCLASTIC CONTROVERSY HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR IT WHILE THE FACT THAT A WOMAN SAT ON THE IMPERIAL THRONE SERVED AS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THE POPE'S ACTION LEO DECLARED THAT A FEMALE REIGN WAS AN ANOMALY AND AN ABOMINATION
7859-102521-0016 AND TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE ONUS OF ENDING IT SO FAR AS ITALY WAS CONCERNED BY CREATING A NEW EMPEROR OF THE WEST
7859-102521-0017 THERE WAS OF COURSE NO LEGALITY IN THE ACT AND KARL THE GREAT WAS IN NO REAL SENSE THE SUCCESSOR OF HONORIUS AND ROMULUS AUGUSTULUS BUT HE RULED A GROUP OF KINGDOMS WHICH EMBRACED THE LARGER HALF OF THE OLD WESTERN EMPIRE AND FORMED A FAIR EQUIPOISE TO THE REALM NOW RULED BY IRENE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED THEN ONWARD WE HAVE ONCE MORE A WEST ROMAN EMPIRE IN EXISTENCE AS WELL AS THE EAST ROMAN

8014-112586-0001 NINETEEN O SEVEN PRINTED BY PONSONBY AND GIBBS UNIVERSITY PRESS DUBLIN PREFACE
8014-112586-0002 THIS LITTLE BOOK HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED WITH THE MAIN OBJECT OF SPREADING AS WIDELY AS POSSIBLE AMONG OUR PEOPLE YOUNG AND OLD A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIVILISATION AND GENERAL SOCIAL CONDITION OF IRELAND FROM THE FIFTH OR SIXTH
8014-112586-0003 WHEN IT WAS WHOLLY GOVERNED BY NATIVE RULERS THE PUBLICATION COMES AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME WHEN THERE IS AN AWAKENING OF INTEREST IN THE IRISH LANGUAGE AND IN IRISH LORE OF EVERY KIND UNPARALLELED IN OUR HISTORY BUT THE BOOK HAS A FURTHER MISSION
8014-112586-0004 THERE ARE MANY ENGLISH AND MANY ANGLO IRISH PEOPLE WHO THINK MERELY FROM IGNORANCE THAT IRELAND WAS A BARBAROUS AND HALF SAVAGE COUNTRY BEFORE THE ENGLISH CAME AMONG THE PEOPLE AND CIVILISED THEM THIS BOOK SO FAR AS IT FINDS ITS WAY AMONG THE TWO CLASSES ABOVE MENTIONED WILL
8014-112586-0005 I FANCY OPEN THEIR EYES THEY WILL LEARN FROM IT THAT THE OLD IRISH SO FAR FROM BEING BARBAROUS WERE A BRIGHT INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURED PEOPLE THAT THEY HAD PROFESSIONS TRADES AND INDUSTRIES PERVADING THE WHOLE POPULATION
8014-112586-0006 WITH CLEARLY DEFINED RANKS AND GRADES OF SOCIETY ALL WORKING UNDER AN ELABORATE SYSTEM OF NATIVE LAWS AND THAT IN THE STEADYING AND CIVILISING ARTS AND PURSUITS OF EVERYDAY LIFE THEY WERE AS WELL ADVANCED AS ORDERLY
8014-112586-0007 AND AS REGULAR AS ANY OTHER EUROPEAN PEOPLE OF THE SAME PERIOD THEY WILL FIND TOO THAT AS REGARDS EDUCATION SCHOLARSHIP AND GENERAL MENTAL CULTURE THE IRISH OF THOSE EARLY AGES WERE IN ADVANCE OF ALL OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE
8014-112586-0008 THAT THEY HELPED MOST MATERIALLY TO SPREAD CHRISTIANITY AND TO REVIVE LEARNING ALL OVER THE CONTINENT AND THAT TO IRISH MISSIONARIES AND SCHOLARS THE ANGLO SAXONS OF THE HEPTARCHY WERE INDEBTED FOR THE GREATER PART OF THEIR CHRISTIANITY
8014-112586-0009 AND FOR THE PRESERVATION AND RESTORATION OF LEARNING WHEN IT WAS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION ALL OVER ENGLAND BY THE RAVAGES OF THE DANES BUT THERE WERE AND ARE ENGLISHMEN BETTER INFORMED ABOUT OUR COUNTRY
8014-112586-0010 MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE GREAT ENGLISH POET EDMUND SPENSER LIVED FOR SOME TIME IN IRELAND AND MADE HIMSELF WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ITS HISTORY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS IN PAST AGES
8014-112586-0011 OF WEALTH AND GOODNESSE FAR ABOVE THE REST
8014-112586-0012 BUT IT IS BETTER NOT TO PURSUE THESE OBSERVATIONS FARTHER HERE AS IT WOULD BE ONLY ANTICIPATING WHAT WILL BE FOUND IN THE BODY OF THE BOOK THIS BOOK IS THE LAST OF A SERIES OF THREE OF WHICH THE SECOND IS ABRIDGED FROM THE FIRST AND THE THIRD FROM BOTH
8014-112586-0013 THE FIRST A SOCIAL HISTORY OF ANCIENT IRELAND
8014-112586-0014 CONTAINS A COMPLETE SURVEY OF THE SOCIAL LIFE AND INSTITUTIONS OF ANCIENT IRELAND ALL THE IMPORTANT STATEMENTS IN IT ARE PROVED HOME BY REFERENCES TO AUTHORITIES
8014-112586-0015 THE SECOND A SMALLER SOCIAL HISTORY OF ANCIENT IRELAND
8014-112586-0016 FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT PAGES IN TWENTY SEVEN CHAPTERS WITH TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN ILLUSTRATIONS TRAVERSES THE SAME GROUND AS THE LARGER WORK BUT BESIDES CONDENSATION MOST OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE QUOTATIONS AND NEARLY ALL THE REFERENCES TO AUTHORITIES ARE OMITTED
8014-112586-0017 THIS THIRD BOOK THE STORY OF ANCIENT IRISH CIVILISATION GIVES IN SIMPLE PLAIN LANGUAGE AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY IN THE OLDEN TIME BUT AS IT IS HERE TO SPEAK FOR ITSELF I NEED NOT DESCRIBE IT FURTHER
8014-112586-0018 FOR ALL THE STATEMENTS IT CONTAINS FULL AND SATISFACTORY AUTHORITIES WILL BE FOUND IN THE TWO LARGER WORKS I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE ALL THREE READABLE AND INTERESTING AS WELL AS INSTRUCTIVE
8014-112586-0019 THE ORDINARY HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MANY AND THE READER HAS A WIDE CHOICE BUT IN THE MATTER OF OUR SOCIAL HISTORY HE HAS NO CHOICE AT ALL FOR THESE THREE BOOKS OF MINE HAVE FOR THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME
8014-112586-0020 BROUGHT WITHIN THE REACH OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC A KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHOLE SOCIAL LIFE OF ANCIENT IRELAND P W J LYRE NA GRENA FEBRUARY
8014-112602-0000 AN OVAL FACE BROAD ABOVE AND NARROW BELOW GOLDEN HAIR FAIR SKIN WHITE DELICATE AND WELL FORMED HANDS WITH SLENDER TAPERING FINGERS THESE WERE CONSIDERED AS MARKING THE TYPE OF BEAUTY AND OF HIGH FAMILY DESCENT
8014-112602-0001 THEY WERE THE MARKS OF ARISTOCRACY TO THESE NATURAL ADVANTAGES THE PEOPLE ADDED BY THE USUAL ARTIFICIAL MEANS AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES THE FINGER NAILS WERE KEPT CAREFULLY CUT AND ROUNDED
8014-112602-0002 IT WAS CONSIDERED SHAMEFUL FOR A MAN OF POSITION TO HAVE ROUGH UNKEMPT NAILS CRIMSON COLOURED FINGER NAILS WERE GREATLY ADMIRED
8014-112602-0003 I SLEEP NO MORE AND I SHALL NOT CRIMSON MY NAILS NO JOY SHALL EVER AGAIN COME UPON MY MIND
8014-112602-0004 LADIES OFTEN DYED THE EYEBROWS BLACK WITH THE JUICE OF SOME SORT OF BERRY
8014-112602-0005 THAT THE IRISH MISSIONARY MONKS SOMETIMES PAINTED OR DYED THEIR EYELIDS BLACK AN ENTRY IN CORMAC'S GLOSSARY PLAINLY INDICATES THAT THE BLUSH OF THE CHEEKS WAS SOMETIMES HEIGHTENED BY A COLOURING MATTER OBTAINED FROM THE ALDER TREE
8014-112602-0006 AND THE SPRIGS AND BERRIES OF THE ELDER WERE APPLIED TO THE SAME PURPOSE AMONG GREEK AND ROMAN LADIES THE PRACTICE WAS VERY GENERAL OF PAINTING THE CHEEKS EYEBROWS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE FACE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WORE THE HAIR LONG
8014-112602-0007 THE HAIR WAS COMBED DAILY AFTER A BATH THE HEROES OF THE FENA OF ERIN BEFORE SITTING DOWN TO THEIR DINNER AFTER A HARD DAY'S HUNTING ALWAYS TOOK A BATH AND CAREFULLY COMBED THEIR LONG HAIR AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES IN VERY EARLY TIMES
8014-112602-0008 GREAT CARE WAS BESTOWED ON THE HAIR ITS REGULATION CONSTITUTED QUITE AN ART AND IT WAS DRESSED UP IN SEVERAL WAYS VERY OFTEN THE LONG HAIR OF MEN AS WELL AS OF WOMEN WAS ELABORATELY CURLED CONALL KERNACH'S HAIR AS DESCRIBED IN THE STORY OF DA DERGA
8014-112602-0009 FLOWED DOWN HIS BACK AND WAS DONE UP IN
8014-112602-0010 HOOKS AND PLAITS AND SWORDLETS
8014-112602-0011 THE ACCURACY OF THIS AND OTHER SIMILAR DESCRIPTIONS IS FULLY BORNE OUT BY THE MOST UNQUESTIONABLE AUTHORITY OF ALL NAMELY THE FIGURES IN THE EARLY ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AND ON THE SHRINES AND HIGH CROSSES OF LATER AGES
8014-112602-0012 IN NEARLY ALL THE FIGURES OF THE BOOK OF KELLS FOR EXAMPLE SEVENTH OR EIGHTH CENTURY THE HAIR IS COMBED AND DRESSED WITH THE UTMOST CARE SO BEAUTIFULLY ADJUSTED INDEED THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE ONLY BY SKILLED PROFESSIONAL HAIRDRESSERS
8014-112602-0013 AND MUST HAVE OCCUPIED MUCH TIME WHETHER IN CASE OF MEN OR WOMEN
8014-112602-0014 AND IS COMMONLY DIVIDED THE WHOLE WAY AS WELL AS ALL OVER THE HEAD INTO SLENDER FILLETS OR LOCKS WHICH SOMETIMES HANG DOWN TO THE EYES IN FRONT I DO NOT FIND MENTIONED ANYWHERE THAT THE IRISH DYED THEIR HAIR AS WAS THE CUSTOM AMONG THE GREEKS AND ROMANS
8014-112602-0015 THE MEN WERE AS PARTICULAR ABOUT THE BEARD AS ABOUT THE HAIR THE FASHION OF WEARING THE BEARD VARIED
8014-112602-0016 AND GRADUALLY NARROWED TO TWO POINTS BELOW SOMETIMES AS SHOWN IN MANY ANCIENT FIGURES IT FALLS DOWN IN A SINGLE MASS WHILE IN A FEW IT IS CUT STRAIGHT ACROSS AT BOTTOM NOT UNLIKE ASSYRIAN BEARDS NEARLY ALL HAVE A MUSTACHE
8014-112602-0017 IN MOST CASES CURLED UP AND POINTED AT THE ENDS AS WE OFTEN SEE NOW IN MANY THE BEARD IS CAREFULLY DIVIDED INTO SLENDER TWISTED FILLETS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR THE HAIR KINGS AND CHIEFS HAD BARBERS IN THEIR SERVICE TO ATTEND TO ALL THIS
8014-112602-0018 RAZORS WERE USED MADE OF BRONZE AS HARD AS STEEL AS WE KNOW BY FINDING THEM MENTIONED IN IRISH DOCUMENTS AS EARLY AS THE EIGHTH CENTURY AND MANY OLD BRONZE RAZORS ARE NOW PRESERVED IN MUSEUMS
8014-112602-0019 FROM WHAT PRECEDES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT COMBS WERE IN GENERAL USE WITH MEN AS WELL AS WITH WOMEN AND MANY SPECIMENS OF COMBS ARE NOW FOUND IN THE REMAINS OF ANCIENT DWELLINGS BATHING WAS VERY USUAL AT LEAST AMONG THE UPPER CLASSES
8014-112602-0020 AND BATHS AND THE USE OF BATHS ARE CONSTANTLY MENTIONED IN THE OLD TALES AND OTHER WRITINGS IN EVERY PUBLIC HOSTEL IN EVERY MONASTERY AND IN EVERY HIGH CLASS HOUSE THERE WAS A BATH WITH ITS ACCOMPANIMENTS SOAP WAS USED BOTH IN BATHING AND WASHING
8014-112602-0021 THE MODES OF MANUFACTURING THEM WILL BE MENTIONED SILK AND SATIN WHICH WERE OF COURSE IMPORTED WERE MUCH WORN AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES THE FURS OF ANIMALS SUCH AS SEALS OTTERS BADGERS FOXES ET CETERA WERE MUCH USED FOR CAPES AND JACKETS
8014-112602-0022 AND FOR THE EDGINGS OF VARIOUS GARMENTS SO THAT SKINS OF ALL THE VARIOUS KINDS WERE VALUABLE THEY FORMED TOO AN IMPORTANT ITEM OF EVERYDAY TRAFFIC AND THEY WERE ALSO EXPORTED THE ANCIENT IRISH LOVED BRIGHT COLOURS
8014-112602-0023 IN THIS RESPECT THEY RESEMBLED MANY OTHER NATIONS OF ANTIQUITY AS WELL INDEED AS OF THE PRESENT DAY AND THEY ILLUSTRATED RUSKIN'S SAYING
8014-112602-0024 WHENEVER MEN ARE NOBLE THEY LOVE BRIGHT COLOUR
8014-112602-0025 IN SKY SEA FLOWERS
8014-112602-0026 AND WE KNOW THAT THEY WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF DYEING THE SEVERAL ARTICLES OF DRESS ON ONE PERSON WERE USUALLY COLOURED DIFFERENTLY EVEN THE SINGLE OUTER CLOAK WAS OFTEN STRIPED SPOTTED OR CHEQUERED IN VARIOUS COLOURS KING DOMNALL IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY
8014-112602-0027 ON ONE OCCASION SENT A MANY COLOURED TUNIC TO HIS FOSTER SON PRINCE CONGAL LIKE JOSEPH'S COAT OF MANY COLOURS A VERY COMMON ARTICLE OF DRESS WAS A LARGE CLOAK GENERALLY WITHOUT SLEEVES
8014-112602-0028 VARYING IN LENGTH BUT COMMONLY COVERING THE WHOLE PERSON FROM THE SHOULDERS DOWN THE PEOPLE ALSO WORE A TIGHT FITTING COAT WITH SLEEVES
8014-112602-0029 BUT IT WAS MUCH SHORTER AND WITHOUT A COLLAR
8014-112602-0030 A SHORT CAPE WAS OFTEN WORN ON THE SHOULDERS SOMETIMES CARRYING A HOOD TO COVER THE HEAD THE OUTER COVERING OF THE GENERAL RUN OF THE PEASANTRY WAS JUST ONE LOOSE SLEEVED COAT OR MANTLE
8014-112602-0031 WHICH COVERED THEM DOWN TO THE ANKLES AND WHICH THEY WORE WINTER AND SUMMER WOMEN COMMONLY WORE A LONG LOOSE CLOAK WITH A HOOD A FASHION WHICH IS COMMON AT THE PRESENT DAY THE OVER GARMENTS WERE FASTENED BY BROOCHES PINS BUTTONS
8014-112602-0032 GIRDLES STRINGS AND LOOPS MANY OF THEM BEAUTIFULLY MADE AND ORNAMENTED THE ANCIENT IRISH WORE A TROUSERS WHICH WAS SO TIGHT FITTING AS TO SHOW PERFECTLY THE SHAPE OF THE LIMBS WHEN TERMINATING BELOW THE ANKLES IT WAS HELD DOWN BY A SLENDER STRAP PASSING UNDER THE FOOT
8014-112602-0033 LIKE OTHER IRISH GARMENTS IT WAS GENERALLY STRIPED OR SPECKLED IN VARIOUS COLOURS LEGGINGS OF CLOTH OR OF THIN SOFT LEATHER WERE USED AND WERE LACED ON BY STRINGS TIPPED WITH WHITE BRONZE
8014-112602-0034 A KILT WAS OFTEN WORN IN WHICH CASE THE LEGS WERE LEFT BARE AT THE KNEES WITH LEGGINGS BELOW FOR THE KILT IS OF IRISH ORIGIN AND WAS BROUGHT LIKE MANY OTHER FASHIONS BY THE EARLY COLONISTS TO SCOTLAND
8014-112602-0035 AND WHEN NOT ACTUALLY WORN WAS USUALLY CARRIED AMONG OTHER SMALL ARTICLES IN A LADY'S ORNAMENTAL HAND BAG SHOES WERE OFTEN MADE OF UNTANNED HIDE STITCHED WITH THONGS WITH SEVERAL LAYERS FOR A SOLE BUT THERE WAS A MORE SHAPELY SHOE MADE OF FULLY TANNED LEATHER
8014-112602-0036 HAVING SERVICEABLE SOLE AND HEEL AND OFTEN ORNAMENTED WITH PATTERNS STAMPED IN THE IRISH WERE EXCESSIVELY FOND OF PERSONAL ORNAMENTS WHICH AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES WERE MADE OF EXPENSIVE MATERIALS SUCH AS GOLD SILVER GEMS WHITE BRONZE ET CETERA
8014-112602-0037 THEY WORE RINGS AND BRACELETS OF VARIOUS SHAPES ON THE FINGERS INCLUDING THE THUMB ROUND THE WRIST AND FOREARM AND EVEN ROUND THE LEG ABOVE THE ANKLE
8014-112602-0038 ALL OF WHICH MATERIALS WERE FOUND NATIVE THEY HAD TORQUES FOR THE NECK MADE OF TWISTED GOLD BARS AND THE ELABORATE AND IMMENSELY EXPENSIVE CRESCENTS OR GORGETS
8014-112602-0039 THERE WAS A GOLD ORNAMENT A KIND OF OPEN RING WITH BOSSES OR BUTTONS ON THE ENDS
8014-112602-0040 WORN ON THE BREAST SUSPENDED FROM AN ORNAMENTED BUTTON THIN CIRCULAR GOLD PLATES WERE ALSO WORN FASTENED ON THE BREAST AND AS FOR BROOCHES THEY WERE OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES SOME PLAIN SIMPLE AND CHEAP
8014-112602-0041 SOME OF GOLD OR OTHER EXPENSIVE MATERIAL OF ELABORATE WORKMANSHIP
8014-280382-0000 FLED TO LARS PORSENNA KING OF CLUSIUM AND BESOUGHT HIM THAT HE WOULD HELP THEM SUFFER NOT THEY SAID THAT WE WHO ARE TUSCANS BY BIRTH SHOULD REMAIN ANY MORE IN POVERTY AND EXILE
8014-280382-0001 AND TAKE HEED ALSO TO THYSELF AND THINE OWN KINGDOM IF THOU PERMIT THIS NEW FASHION OF DRIVING FORTH KINGS TO GO UNPUNISHED
8014-280382-0002 THAT IN FREEDOM WHICH MEN GREATLY DESIRE AND IF THEY THAT BE KINGS DEFEND NOT THEIR DIGNITY AS STOUTLY AS OTHERS SEEK TO OVERTHROW IT THEN SHALL THE HIGHEST BE MADE EVEN AS THE LOWEST AND THERE SHALL BE AN END OF KINGSHIP THAN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING MORE HONORABLE UNDER HEAVEN
8014-280382-0003 WITH THESE WORDS THEY PERSUADED KING PORSENNA WHO JUDGING IT WELL FOR THE ETRURIANS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A KING AT ROME AND THAT KING AN ETRURIAN BY BIRTH GATHERED TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY AND CAME UP AGAINST ROME
8014-280382-0004 BUT WHEN MEN HEARD OF HIS COMING SO MIGHTY A CITY WAS CLUSIUM IN THOSE DAYS AND SO GREAT THE FAME OF KING PORSENNA
8014-280382-0005 IN THE MEANWHILE I SO FAR AS ONE MAN MAY DO WILL STAY THE ENEMY AND AS HE SPAKE HE RAN FORWARD TO THE FARTHER END OF THE BRIDGE AND MADE READY TO KEEP THE WAY AGAINST THE ENEMY NEVERTHELESS THERE STOOD TWO WITH HIM
8014-280382-0006 LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS BY NAME MEN OF NOBLE BIRTH BOTH OF THEM AND OF GREAT RENOWN IN ARMS SO THESE THREE FOR A WHILE STAYED THE FIRST ONSET OF THE ENEMY AND THE MEN OF ROME MEANWHILE BRAKE DOWN THE BRIDGE AND WHEN THERE WAS BUT A SMALL PART REMAINING
8014-280382-0007 AND THEY THAT BRAKE IT DOWN CALLED TO THE THREE THAT THEY SHOULD COME BACK HORATIUS BADE LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS RETURN BUT HE HIMSELF REMAINED ON THE FARTHER SIDE TURNING HIS EYES FULL OF WRATH IN THREATENING FASHION ON THE PRINCES OF THE ETRURIANS AND CRYING
8014-280382-0008 KING PORSENNA TO ROB OTHERS OF THE FREEDOM THAT YE CARE NOT TO HAVE FOR YOURSELVES
8014-280382-0009 LOOKING EACH MAN TO HIS NEIGHBOR WHO SHOULD FIRST DEAL WITH THIS CHAMPION OF THE ROMANS THEN FOR VERY SHAME THEY ALL RAN FORWARD AND RAISING A GREAT SHOUT THREW THEIR JAVELINS AT HIM THESE ALL HE TOOK UPON HIS SHIELD NOR STOOD THE LESS FIRMLY IN HIS PLACE ON THE BRIDGE
8014-280382-0010 FOR THE BRIDGE WAS NOW ALTOGETHER BROKEN DOWN
