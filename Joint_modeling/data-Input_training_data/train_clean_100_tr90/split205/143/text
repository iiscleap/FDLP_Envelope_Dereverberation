5688-15787-0017 WE HAD ABOUT TWELVE OR FOURTEEN MILES TO WALK TO THE GREAT FOREST DIGGINGS THAT HAD GIVEN ME THE FEVER IN LONDON WE STOPPED AT SAWPIT GULLY AND HAD A REST AND BEER SIX MILES MORE AND THEN WE SAW WHAT IS NOT EASILY FORGOTTEN
5688-15787-0018 WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT THE CREEK AND WERE ASTONISHED TO SEE THE NUMBER OF TENTS THE THOUSANDS AT WORK MEN WOMEN GIRLS AND BOYS OF ALL AGES AND THE DEEP HOLES NEARLY FRIGHTENED ME
5688-15787-0019 JOE JOE WHICH WAS RESPONDED TO ALL ROUND THE DIGGINGS IT WAS A SAYING OR CRY THEY HAD WHEN THE POLICE WENT ROUND TO EXAMINE THEIR LICENCES I AND MY PARTY WALKED ON TAKING OBSERVATIONS WHEN ALL AT ONCE SOME ONE CALLED OUT IS THAT YOU PLUMBER GEORGE

5688-15787-0026 THEN MISTER POSTMAN PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD GO WITH HIM TO JOHNNY ALLSORT'S STORE AND GET SOME BEER WHILE THE DINNER WAS COOKING TO WHICH WE ALL AGREED

5688-15787-0038 WE ARRANGED THAT PLUMBER GEORGE WAS TO BE COOK FOR THE FIRST WEEK AND THE FIRST THING THAT HE HAD TO DO WAS TO CHOP A TREE DOWN BUT FIDDLER JIM HOWEVER HAD TO HELP HIM I WENT OFF TO THE BUTCHER'S SHOP AND GOT CREDIT FOR A QUARTER OF MUTTON

5688-15787-0041 I'LL TRY MY FRIEND MISTER POSTMAN SAID GEORGE HE DID SO AND GOT IT WE THEN TOOK A WALK TO THE COMMISSIONER'S TENT AND GOT OUR LICENCES AFTER WHICH WE HAD A GOOD LOOK OVER THE TOWNSHIP WHICH WAS CALLED CASTLEMAINE AND IS SO CALLED TO THIS DAY
5688-15787-0042 ITS ORIGINAL NAME HOWEVER WAS MOUNT ALEXANDER

5688-15787-0045 THE DEEPER WE WENT THE LABOR OF GETTING THE STUFF TO THE SURFACE WAS INCREASED AS EVERY BIT HAD TO BE DRAWN UP IN BUCKETS THE THIRD DAY WE GOT TO THE PIPE CLAY UNDER WHICH WAS FOUND A SMALL DEPOSIT OF GRAVEL
5688-41232-0000 APPENDIX A THE INFLUENCE OF MENSTRUATION ON THE POSITION OF WOMEN A QUESTION OF HISTORICAL PSYCHOLOGY
5688-41232-0001 IN REGARD TO WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK WITH CERTAINTY BUT WE HERE STRIKE ON A FACTOR OF SUCH IMPORTANCE SUCH NEGLECTED IMPORTANCE FOR THE PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SEXUAL RELATIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN THAT IT CANNOT BE WHOLLY IGNORED
5688-41232-0002 AMONG THE NEGROES OF SURINAM A WOMAN MUST LIVE IN SOLITUDE DURING THE TIME OF HER PERIOD IT IS DANGEROUS FOR ANY MAN OR WOMAN TO APPROACH HER AND WHEN SHE SEES A PERSON COMING NEAR SHE CRIES OUT ANXIOUSLY
5688-41232-0003 I AM UNCLEAN I AM UNCLEAN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WE FIND TRACES OF THE CUSTOM OF WHICH THIS IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE BUT WE MUST NOT TOO HASTILY ASSUME THAT THIS CUSTOM IS EVIDENCE OF THE INFERIOR POSITION OCCUPIED BY SEMI CIVILIZED WOMEN
5688-41232-0004 IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE A BROAD VIEW NOT ONLY OF THE BELIEFS OF SEMI CIVILIZED MAN REGARDING MENSTRUATION
5688-41232-0005 HAVE BEEN CREDITED WITH SOME DESIGN SINISTER OR EROTIC ON WOMEN
5688-41232-0006 ALL THESE FIGURES ARE REPRODUCED BY PLOSS AND BARTELS EVEN IN MODERN EUROPE THE SAME IDEAS PREVAIL IN PORTUGAL ACCORDING TO REYS IT IS BELIEVED THAT DURING MENSTRUATION WOMEN ARE LIABLE TO BE BITTEN BY LIZARDS
5688-41232-0007 AND TO GUARD AGAINST THIS RISK THEY WEAR DRAWERS DURING THE PERIOD IN GERMANY AGAIN IT WAS BELIEVED UP TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AT LEAST
5688-41232-0008 TO BUILD UP THIS WORLD WIDE BELIEF REGARDING THE ORIGIN OF MENSTRUATION THIS PRIMITIVE THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF MENSTRUATION PROBABLY BRINGS BEFORE US IN ITS EARLIEST SHAPE THE SPECIAL AND INTIMATE BOND WHICH HAS EVER BEEN HELD TO CONNECT WOMEN
5688-41232-0009 BY VIRTUE OF THE MENSTRUAL PROCESS WITH THE NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL POWERS OF THE WORLD EVERYWHERE MENSTRUATING WOMEN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE POSSESSED BY SPIRITS AND CHARGED WITH MYSTERIOUS FORCES IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT A SERIOUS MISCONCEPTION
5688-41232-0010 AS A MATTER OF FACT HOWEVER THE SAVAGE RARELY DISCRIMINATES BETWEEN BAD AND GOOD SPIRITS EVERY SPIRIT MAY HAVE EITHER A BENEFICIAL OR MALIGNANT INFLUENCE
5688-41232-0011 THE IMPORTANCE OF RECOGNIZING THE SPECIAL SENSE IN WHICH THE WORD UNCLEAN IS USED IN THIS CONNECTION WAS CLEARLY POINTED OUT BY ROBERTSON SMITH IN THE CASE OF THE SEMITES
5688-41232-0012 IS NOT THE ORDINARY WORD FOR THINGS PHYSICALLY FOUL IT IS A RITUAL TERM AND CORRESPONDS EXACTLY TO THE IDEA OF TABOO THE IDEAS UNCLEAN AND HOLY SEEM TO US TO STAND IN POLAR OPPOSITION TO ONE ANOTHER
5688-41232-0013 BUT IT WAS NOT SO WITH THE SEMITES AMONG THE LATER JEWS THE HOLY BOOKS DEFILED THE HANDS OF THE READER AS CONTACT WITH AN IMPURE THING DID AMONG LUCIAN'S SYRIANS
5688-41232-0014 WELLHAUSEN HOWEVER DEALING WITH THE EARLY ARABIANS EXPRESSLY MENTIONS THAT IN PRE ISLAMIC DAYS CLEAN AND UNCLEAN WERE USED SOLELY WITH REFERENCE TO WOMEN IN AND OUT OF THE MENSTRUAL STATE
5688-41232-0015 AT A LATER DATE FRAZER DEVELOPED THIS ASPECT OF THE CONCEPTION OF TABOO AND SHOWED HOW IT OCCURS AMONG SAVAGE RACES GENERALLY HE POINTED OUT THAT THE CONCEPTIONS OF HOLINESS AND POLLUTION NOT HAVING YET BEEN DIFFERENTIATED
5688-41232-0016 WOMEN AT CHILDBIRTH AND DURING MENSTRUATION ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL AS DIVINE KINGS CHIEFS AND PRIESTS AND MUST OBSERVE THE SAME RULES OF CEREMONIAL PURITY TO SECLUDE SUCH PERSONS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD SO THAT THE DREADED SPIRITUAL DANGER SHALL NOT SPREAD
5688-41232-0017 IS THE OBJECT OF THE TABOO WHICH FRAZER COMPARES TO AN ELECTRICAL INSULATOR TO PRESERVE THE SPIRITUAL FORCE WITH WHICH THESE PERSONS ARE CHARGED FROM SUFFERING OR INFLICTING HARM BY CONTACT WITH THE OUTER WORLD
5688-41232-0018 AFTER DESCRIBING THE PHENOMENA ESPECIALLY THE PROHIBITION TO TOUCH THE GROUND OR SEE THE SUN FOUND AMONG VARIOUS RACES FRAZER CONCLUDES
5688-41232-0019 THE OBJECT OF SECLUDING WOMEN AT MENSTRUATION IS TO NEUTRALIZE THE DANGEROUS INFLUENCES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO EMANATE FROM THEM AT SUCH TIMES THE GENERAL EFFECT OF THESE RULES IS TO KEEP THE GIRL SUSPENDED SO TO SAY BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH
5688-41232-0020 WHETHER ENVELOPED IN HER HAMMOCK AND SLUNG UP TO THE ROOF AS IN SOUTH AMERICA OR ELEVATED ABOVE THE GROUND IN A DARK AND NARROW CAGE AS IN NEW ZEALAND SHE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE OUT OF THE WAY OF DOING MISCHIEF SINCE BEING SHUT OFF BOTH FROM THE EARTH AND FROM THE SUN
5688-41232-0021 THE PRECAUTIONS THUS TAKEN TO ISOLATE OR INSULATE THE GIRL ARE DICTATED BY REGARD FOR HER OWN SAFETY AS WELL AS FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS IN SHORT THE GIRL IS VIEWED AS CHARGED WITH A POWERFUL FORCE WHICH IF NOT KEPT WITHIN BOUNDS
5688-41232-0022 MAY PROVE THE DESTRUCTION BOTH OF THE GIRL HERSELF AND OF ALL WITH WHOM SHE COMES IN CONTACT TO REPRESS THIS FORCE WITHIN THE LIMITS NECESSARY FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL CONCERNED IS THE OBJECT OF THE TABOOS IN QUESTION
5688-41232-0023 THE SAME EXPLANATION APPLIES TO THE OBSERVANCE OF THE SAME RULES BY DIVINE KINGS AND PRIESTS
5688-41232-0024 AND ARGUING THAT IT PROCEEDS FROM THE CUSTOM OF EXOGAMY OR MARRIAGE OUTSIDE THE CLAN AND THAT THIS RESTS ON CERTAIN IDEAS ABOUT BLOOD WHICH AGAIN ARE TRACEABLE TO TOTEMISM A THEORY WHICH WE NEED NOT HERE DISCUSS
5688-41232-0025 DURKHEIM IS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE GROUP OF CONCEPTIONS THAT NOW CONCERN US HE INSISTS ON THE EXTREME AMBIGUITY FOUND IN PRIMITIVE CULTURE CONCERNING THE NOTION OF THE DIVINE AND THE CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN AVERSION AND VENERATION
5688-41232-0026 AND POINTS OUT THAT IT IS NOT ONLY AT PUBERTY AND EACH RECURRENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL EPOCH THAT WOMEN HAVE AROUSED THESE EMOTIONS BUT ALSO AT CHILDBIRTH A SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS HORROR HE CONTINUES
5688-41232-0027 WHICH CAN REACH SUCH A DEGREE OF INTENSITY WHICH CAN BE CALLED FORTH BY SO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND REAPPEARS REGULARLY EVERY MONTH TO LAST FOR A WEEK AT LEAST CANNOT FAIL TO EXTEND ITS INFLUENCE BEYOND THE PERIODS TO WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY CONFINED
5688-41232-0028 AND TO AFFECT THE WHOLE COURSE OF LIFE A BEING WHO MUST BE SECLUDED OR AVOIDED FOR WEEKS MONTHS OR YEARS PRESERVES SOMETHING OF THE CHARACTERISTICS TO WHICH THE ISOLATION WAS DUE EVEN OUTSIDE THOSE SPECIAL PERIODS
5688-41232-0029 AND IN FACT IN THESE COMMUNITIES THE SEPARATION OF THE SEXES IS NOT MERELY INTERMITTENT IT HAS BECOME CHRONIC THE TWO ELEMENTS OF THE POPULATION LIVE SEPARATELY
5688-41232-0030 DURKHEIM PROCEEDS TO ARGUE THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE OCCULT POWERS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FEMININE ORGANISM IS TO BE FOUND IN PRIMITIVE IDEAS CONCERNING BLOOD NOT ONLY MENSTRUAL BLOOD BUT ANY KIND OF BLOOD IS THE OBJECT OF SUCH FEELINGS AMONG SAVAGE AND BARBAROUS PEOPLES
5688-41232-0031 THE PROHIBITION TO DRINK WINE THE BLOOD OF THE GRAPE FOUND AMONG SOME PEOPLES IS TRACED TO ITS RESEMBLANCE TO BLOOD AND TO ITS SACRIFICIAL EMPLOYMENT AS AMONG THE ANCIENT ARABIANS AND STILL IN THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR DRINKING BLOOD
5688-41232-0032 THROUGHOUT BLOOD IS GENERALLY TABOO AND IT TABOOS EVERYTHING THAT COMES IN CONTACT WITH IT NOW WOMAN IS CHRONICALLY THE THEATRE OF BLOODY MANIFESTATIONS AND THEREFORE SHE TENDS TO BECOME CHRONICALLY TABOO FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY
5688-41232-0033 A MORE OR LESS CONSCIOUS ANXIETY A CERTAIN RELIGIOUS FEAR CANNOT FAIL TO ENTER INTO ALL THE RELATIONS OF HER COMPANIONS WITH HER AND THAT IS WHY ALL SUCH RELATIONS ARE REDUCED TO A MINIMUM RELATIONS OF A SEXUAL CHARACTER ARE SPECIALLY EXCLUDED
5688-41232-0034 IN THE FIRST PLACE SUCH RELATIONS ARE SO INTIMATE THAT THEY ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SORT OF REPULSION WHICH THE SEXES MUST EXPERIENCE FOR EACH OTHER THE BARRIER BETWEEN THEM DOES NOT PERMIT OF SUCH A CLOSE UNION IN THE SECOND PLACE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY HERE SPECIALLY CONCERNED
5688-41232-0035 ARE PRECISELY THE SOURCE OF THE DREADED MANIFESTATIONS THUS IT IS NATURAL THAT THE FEELINGS OF AVERSION INSPIRED BY WOMEN ATTAIN THEIR GREATEST INTENSITY AT THIS POINT
5688-41232-0036 IN ANY CASE INDEED THE SAME IDEAS BEING TRANSFERRED TO WOMEN ALSO COITUS PRODUCES WEAKNESS AND IT PREVENTS THE ACQUISITION OF SUPERNATURAL POWERS THUS AMONG THE WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA BOAS STATES
5688-41232-0037 ONLY A YOUTH WHO HAS NEVER TOUCHED A WOMAN OR A VIRGIN
5688-41232-0038 AFTER HAVING HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE MEN AS WELL AS WOMEN
5688-41232-0039 YET THE TWOFOLD INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN REMAINS CLEAR WHEN WE REVIEW THE WHOLE GROUP OF INFLUENCES WHICH IN THIS STATE SHE IS SUPPOSED TO EXERT SHE BY NO MEANS ACTS ONLY BY PARALYZING SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND DESTROYING THE POWERS OF LIFE
5688-41232-0040 OH MENSTRUATING WOMAN THOU'RT A FIEND FROM WHOM ALL NATURE SHOULD BE CLOSELY SCREENED HER POWERS ARE ALSO BENEFICIAL
5688-41232-0041 IS IN REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH THE STARRY BODIES
5688-41232-0042 IN OUR OWN TIME THE SLOW DISINTEGRATION OF PRIMITIVE ANIMISTIC CONCEPTIONS AIDED CERTAINLY BY THE DEGRADED CONCEPTION OF SEXUAL PHENOMENA TAUGHT BY MEDIAEVAL MONKS FOR WHOM WOMAN WAS TEMPLUM AEDIFICATUM SUPER CLOACAM
5688-41232-0043 HAS LED TO A DISBELIEF IN THE MORE SALUTARY INFLUENCES OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN A FAIRLY WIDESPREAD FAITH IN HER PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE ALONE SURVIVES IT MAY BE TRACED EVEN IN PRACTICAL AND COMMERCIAL ONE MIGHT ADD MEDICAL QUARTERS
5688-41232-0044 IN THE GREAT SUGAR REFINERIES IN THE NORTH OF FRANCE THE REGULATIONS STRICTLY FORBID A WOMAN TO ENTER THE FACTORY WHILE THE SUGAR IS BOILING OR COOLING THE REASON GIVEN BEING THAT IF A WOMAN WERE TO ENTER DURING HER PERIOD THE SUGAR WOULD BLACKEN
5688-41232-0045 FOR THE SAME REASON TO TURN TO THE EAST NO WOMAN IS EMPLOYED IN THE OPIUM MANUFACTORY AT SAIGON IT BEING SAID THAT THE OPIUM WOULD TURN AND BECOME BITTER
5688-41232-0046 DECLARED THAT ONE OF THE WOMEN WORKERS MUST BE MENSTRUATING ALL THE WOMEN HINDUS MAHOMETANS ABORIGINAL GONDS ET CETERA SHOWED BY THEIR ENERGETIC DENIALS THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THIS SUPERSTITION
5688-41232-0047 ASKING WHETHER IT WAS TRUE THAT IF A WOMAN CURED HAMS WHILE MENSTRUATING THE HAMS WOULD BE SPOILED HE HAD KNOWN THIS TO HAPPEN TWICE ANOTHER MEDICAL MAN WROTE THAT IF SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE PATIENTS OF MENSTRUATING LADY DOCTORS
5688-41232-0048 A THIRD WROTE IN THE JOURNAL FOR APRIL TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I THOUGHT THE FACT WAS SO GENERALLY KNOWN TO EVERY HOUSEWIFE AND COOK THAT MEAT WOULD SPOIL IF SALTED AT THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD THAT I AM SURPRISED TO SEE SO MANY LETTERS ON THE SUBJECT IN THE JOURNAL
5688-41232-0049 IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE FACT THAT MEAT WILL BE TAINTED IF CURED BY WOMEN AT THE CATAMENIAL PERIOD
5688-41232-0050 HAVE THOUGHT AND TAUGHT THAT THE PRESENCE OF A MENSTRUATING WOMAN WOULD POLLUTE SOLEMN RELIGIOUS RITES WOULD SOUR MILK SPOIL THE FERMENTATION IN WINE VATS AND MUCH OTHER MISCHIEF IN A GENERAL WAY INFLUENCED BY HOARY TRADITION
5688-41232-0051 BUT WHY THIS DELAY IF TIME IS PRECIOUS AND IT ENTERS AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CASE
5688-41232-0052 FOR BEING SWOLLEN THEN BY THE AFFLUX OF BLOOD
