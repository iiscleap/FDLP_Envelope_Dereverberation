7800-283478-0002 FRANK YOU TALK WITH HIM I'D BE APT TO GET SASSY IF HE SCOLDED TOO HARD SO IT USUALLY CAME ABOUT UPON FRANK'S SHOULDERS WAS LAID THE BURDEN OF EXTRICATING THEM FROM NUMEROUS MISHAPS BUT FRANK RATHER LIKED BEING MADE THE SCAPEGOAT
7800-283478-0003 HE HELD UP SOMETHING HE HAD IN HIS HAND SO THAT EVERY ONE COULD SEE IT WAS A STONE THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT WITH SOME OF THE SNOW STILL ADHERING TO ITS SIDES BLUFF RUBBED THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AT SEEING THIS
7800-283478-0004 AS THOUGH WONDERING WHETHER THE MISSILE THAT HAD STRUCK HIM THERE HAD ALSO BEEN LOADED IN THAT WAY WE'RE SORRY MISTER CHASE THAT YOUR WINDOW WAS BROKEN SAID FRANK STEADILY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT I GIVE YOU MY WORD ABOUT THAT

7800-283478-0009 IT ISN'T FAIR FOR YOU TO PAY THE BILL LET HIM GO AFTER ANDY NO I PREFER SETTLING THE ACCOUNT MYSELF AND NOT HAVING ANY TROUBLE ABOUT IT FRANK TOLD HIS OBJECTING CHUMS BESIDES WE'VE HAD ENOUGH FUN OUT OF THE BUSINESS TO STAND A LITTLE EXPENSE LIKE THAT
7800-283478-0010 THE INNOCENT OFTEN HAVE TO SUFFER FOR THE GUILTY SOME OF THE BYSTANDERS AT THIS POINT TRIED TO CONVINCE MISTER CHASE THAT FRANK WAS ENTIRELY INNOCENT OF THE WHOLE TRANSACTION BUT THE MISER ACTING ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BUSH
7800-283478-0011 HE INSISTED STUBBORNLY AND THESE BOYS ADMIT THEY WERE CONNECTED WITH THE ROWDY CREW THAT MADE THEMSELVES A DISGRACE TO THE TOWN IN FRONT OF MY DOOR I SHALL EXPECT HIM TO FULFILL HIS OFFER WHICH YOU HEARD HIM MAKE MISTER JENKINS AND MISTER MOLE
7800-283478-0012 THE SOONER THAT WINDOW PANE IS REPLACED THE BETTER I SHALL BE PLEASED THAT'S ENOUGH WITH THAT HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE GROUP AND HURRIED TO REENTER HIS HOUSE AS THOUGH FEARFUL LEST SOME OF THE SPECTATORS MIGHT ENDEAVOR TO SHAME HIM OUT OF ACCEPTING PAY FROM AN INNOCENT PARTY
7800-283478-0013 FRANK AND HIS THREE COMRADES STOOD TALKING WITH SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD GATHERED WHEN THE CRASH OF BROKEN GLASS FOLLOWED BY ANGRY WORDS IN THE HIGH PITCHED VOICE OF THE MISER DREW ATTENTION TO THE SCENE OF ACTION COME LET'S BE MOVING ALONG FELLOWS BLUFF FINALLY REMARKED
7800-283478-0014 IT GALLED HIM TO THINK THEY HAD BEEN MADE THE SCAPEGOATS BY ANDY LASHER AND HIS SET THOUGH HE KNEW ONLY TOO WELL THAT ONCE FRANK'S MIND WAS MADE UP TO PAY FOR THE BROKEN WINDOW NOTHING COULD CHANGE HIM TRUE TO HIS PROMISE FRANK FIRST OF ALL VISITED THE HARDWARE STORE

7800-283478-0018 ALTHOUGH THE LATTER HAD NOT BEEN A RESIDENT THERE MUCH MORE THAN THREE YEARS
7800-283478-0019 BELIEVE ME I'LL LET YOU BOYS OFF AS LIGHTLY AS I CAN AND NOT LOSE BY IT WAS WHAT HE TOLD THEM
7800-283478-0020 AS THE FOUR CHUMS WENT AWAY JERRY CHUCKLED

7800-283478-0029 IF WE'RE GOING TO GET IN MANY AFFAIRS LIKE THE ONE WE JUST HAD WITH ANDY LASHER AND HIS CROWD THE LATTER REMARKED IT STANDS TO REASON WE WANT TO TUNE UP SOME IN OUR HEAVING MY BASEBALL ARM IS OUT OF PRACTICE AND I'M ASHAMED TO SAY THAT THREE OUT OF FOUR BALLS I FIRED MISSED THEIR MARK

7800-283492-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN DID TEDDY KNOW WELL WOULDN'T THAT JAR YOU REMARKED BLUFF AS HE HEARD WHAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE BRIEF COMMUNICATION FROM THE LUMBERMAN TRIED TO BURN DOWN THE CAMP AT LUMBER RUN DID THEY BURST OUT JERRY
7800-283492-0001 WELL IF YOU ASKED ME MY OPINION I'D HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF A FEW OF THOSE LUMBERJACKS BUT NOBODY HAS ACCUSED ANY OF THE LOGGERS OF THE CRIME REMARKED FRANK AND AT THAT THE HEAD PROJECTING FROM THE OPENING AT THE DOOR CAME A LITTLE FURTHER INTO VIEW
7800-283492-0002 WHICH WAS PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE FRANK THOUGHT THAT THE WOUNDED BOY MUST TAKE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THE DISCUSSION WHY WHO ELSE WOULD TRY TO TURN ON MISTER DARREL THAT WAY AND BURN HIS SHANTIES DOWN JUST WHEN WINTER IS SETTING IN ASKED BLUFF
7800-283492-0003 WE CAN ONLY GIVE A GUESS AT THAT FRANK TOLD HIM WHEW EXCLAIMED BLUFF AS HE GRASPED THE MEANING BACK OF THOSE FEW WORDS AFTER ALL I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST HIM FRANK
7800-283492-0004 AND NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THESE STRANGE HINTS PORTENDED WE HAD A SPECIMEN OF HIS NASTY TEMPER YOU KNOW CONTINUED BLUFF YES TWICE NOW WE'VE HEARD HIM TEAR AROUND LIKE A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP
7800-283492-0005 OH NOW I TUMBLE TO WHAT YOU MEAN CRIED WILL WHO DID NOT OFTEN USE ANY SORT OF SLANG AND MUST THEREFORE HAVE BEEN UNUSUALLY EXCITED TO FALL INTO THE HABIT IT'S BILL BILL NACKERSON FRANK NODDED HIS HEAD
7800-283492-0006 HE'S THE ONLY PARTY AROUND THAT WE KNOW OF WHO WOULD BE MEAN ENOUGH TO TRY TO SET BUILDINGS ON FIRE JUST TO GET EVEN WITH A MAN HE DISLIKED HE OBSERVED
7800-283492-0007 YES AND DIDN'T WE HEAR HIM THREATEN TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE LONG SO AS TO HIT BACK AT MISTER DARREL JERRY WANTED TO KNOW AS IF HE HAD ALL ALONG BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF THE BIG SPORTSMAN
7800-283492-0008 WHY HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF SOME OF THEM WHOEVER STARTED THE FIRE DIDN'T CARE A HOOT WHETHER IT HURT OR NOT I THINK BLUFF GAVE AS HIS OPINION FRANK NOTICED THAT THE HEAD HAD DISAPPEARED FROM ALONGSIDE THE OPEN DOOR
7800-283492-0009 EVIDENTLY TEDDY HAD HEARD ENOUGH HE MUST HAVE LIMPED FROM HIS CHAIR TO THE DOORWAY UPON HEARING STRANGE VOICES OUTSIDE PERHAPS HE HAD SUSPECTED THAT THE OTHERS BROUGHT NEWS OF SOME STARTLING CHARACTER FRANK DID NOT TELL ALL OF HIS CHUMS ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SEEN
7800-283492-0010 AT THE SAME TIME IT GAVE HIM FOOD FOR MUCH SERIOUS THOUGHT I WOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF TEDDY KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT FIRE BUSINESS HE MENTIONED TO BLUFF A SHORT TIME LATER WHEN THEY WALKED TOGETHER DOWN TO THE SPOT WHERE THE MINK TRACKS HAD BEEN SEEN
7800-283492-0011 I SAW HIS HEAD THOUGH AFTER A BIT WHEN WE HAD TALKED MATTERS OVER HE WENT BACK TO THE FIRE AGAIN
7800-283492-0012 OH NO IT ISN'T SO BAD AS THAT HE WAS ASSURED
7800-283492-0013 THE BIG COWARD MUTTERED BLUFF CLENCHING HIS FISTS AND SHAKING HIS HEAD AS THOUGH HE WOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO GET IN A BLOW AT THE BULLY MY OPINION AS FAR AS I HAVE ANY IS ABOUT LIKE THIS FRANK CONTINUED
7800-283492-0014 AFTER NACKERSON STRUCK TEDDY THE BOY HAPPENED TO OVERHEAR HIM BOASTING ABOUT WHAT HE MEANT TO DO TO THE CAMP AT LUMBER RUN OH I SEE NOW WHAT YOU MEAN FRANK
7800-283492-0015 YOU'VE GOT IT ABOUT STRAIGHT BLUFF FRANK ADMITTED OF COURSE I'M ONLY GUESSING ALL THIS REMEMBER
7800-283492-0016 HE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD KEEP A STILL TONGUE IN HIS HEAD TO SHIELD A RASCAL WHO DIDN'T HESITATE TO STRIKE HIM A COWARDLY BLOW BLUFF WAS NOT SLOW OF COMPREHENSION
7800-283492-0017 JUST AS YOU SAY TEDDY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO PUT THE MATCH TO THE CAMP OVER AT LUMBER RUN WHEN NACKERSON HAD GONE AWAY PERHAPS WITH ONE OF HIS PALS WHO AGREED TO STAND BACK OF HIM THAT'S THE TIME TEDDY LIT OUT
7800-283492-0018 HE STRUCK IT PRETTY HARD AT FIRST GETTING CAUGHT IN THAT TRAP FRANK MUSED BUT WHEN YOU COME RIGHT DOWN TO FACTS I GUESS IT WAS JUST AS WELL THAT IT HAPPENED TO HIM HUH THAT'S A QUEER THING TO SAY REMONSTRATED BLUFF
7800-283492-0019 BLUFF ADMITTED AS TEDDY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE HUNG OUT AND COULDN'T FIND HIS WAY TO LUMBER RUN CAMP YOU CAN SEE THAT HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GOING BACK TO NACKERSON OR LOSING HIMSELF IN THE BIG WOODS
7800-283492-0020 WHEW IT DOES TAKE YOU TO SEE THROUGH THINGS BLUFF DECLARED WITH A LAUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND NOW THAT IT WAS A BIG STREAK OF LUCK FOR TED WHEN HE MET WITH THAT BEAR TRAP WE NEVER KNOW WHEN WE'RE WELL OFF DO WE
7800-283492-0021 FRANK WAS ALWAYS ACCOMMODATING ESPECIALLY WHEN ANYTHING CONNECTED WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE WAS CONCERNED HE LOVED TO WATCH THE SMALL WOODS FOLK WHEN THEY DID NOT SUSPECT HIS PRESENCE AND LEARN MORE AND MORE OF THEIR INTERESTING HABITS
7800-283492-0022 SO THAT DAY PASSED ANOTHER AND YET A THIRD FOUND THE BOYS ENJOYING THEMSELVES TO THE LIMIT TEDDY WAS SHOWING DECIDED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT HE COULD GET AROUND FAIRLY WELL BY NOW JERRY HAVING CUT HIM A WALKING STICK WITH A CROOK AT THE END
7800-283492-0023 HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET OVER THE NERVOUSNESS THAT HAD SHOWN ITSELF FOR A WHOLE DAY FOLLOWING HIS ADVENT IN THE NEW CAMP
7800-283492-0024 TO GO BACK TO THAT OTHER DRUDGERY WOULD HAVE BEEN TORTURE AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE TO GET AROUND HE INSISTED ON TAKING CHARGE OF THE COOKING AND THE BOYS SOON LEARNED THAT TEDDY COULD MANAGE SPLENDIDLY
7800-283492-0025 HE HAD TO BE SHOWN VERY LITTLE SO AS TO SUIT THEIR TASTES AND NONE OF THEM REGRETTED IN THE LEAST THAT THEY HAD EXTENDED A HELPING HAND TOWARD ONE IN DISTRESS A NEW LIFE WAS OPENING UP TO TEDDY
7800-283492-0026 HE HAD NEVER BEFORE COME IN CONTACT WITH SUCH AN AGREEABLE LOT OF COMPANIONS AND EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY HE TRIED TO PROVE HIMSELF GRATEFUL STILL HE DID NOT MENTION A WORD ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT POSSIBLY KNOW OF THE DASTARDLY DEED
7800-283492-0027 WHEN SOME ONE ATTEMPTED TO FIRE THE LOGGING CAMP FRANK OFTEN SAW A WORRIED EXPRESSION COME OVER THE BOY'S FACE AND AT SUCH TIMES HE SUSPECTED THAT TEDDY WAS PUZZLING HIS BRAIN AS TO JUST WHAT HIS DUTY MIGHT BE
7800-283492-0028 AND IF HE DOES IT WILL NOT BE THE REWARD OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR INFORMATION THAT WILL MAKE HIM TELL ON THE SECOND DAY ABOUT NOON SOME OF THE BOYS WERE BUSY NEAR THE CABIN LAYING IN AN EXTRA SUPPLY OF FIREWOOD
7800-283492-0029 FRANK HAD AN IDEA THEY WOULD BE VISITED BY A BIG SNOWFALL BEFORE TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAD PASSED OF COURSE THAT'S ONLY A HAZARD FELLOWS HE TOLD BLUFF AND JERRY WHO WERE HELPING HIM ADD TO THE HANDY HEAP CLOSE TO THE DOOR OF THE CABIN
7800-283492-0030 BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A FEELING OF DAMPNESS IN THE AIR FOR ALL IT'S SO COLD AND THE SUN YOU NOTICE SHINES THROUGH A SORT OF HAZY CURTAIN I THINK JUST THE SAME WAY YOU DO FRANK JERRY REMARKED AND IF YOU ASKED ME TO SAY WHEN
7800-283492-0031 I'D GUESS IT WAS GOING TO STRIKE US BEFORE NIGHT WE'VE GOT OFF PRETTY FORTUNATELY SO FAR ABOUT STORMS BLUFF WENT ON AS HE THREW ANOTHER ARMFUL OF FUEL ON THE ALREADY HUGE PILE
7800-283492-0032 AND TO THINK IT HAPPENED SO NEAR OUR CAMP THAT WE MANAGED TO TOTE THE WHOLE CARCASS TO THE CABIN AND BLUFF LOOKED WITH PRIDE IN HIS EYES TOWARD A DEER THAT WAS HANGING IN REAL SPORTSMAN STYLE FROM A LIMB HEAD DOWNWARD
7800-283492-0033 IF WE DON'T GET ANOTHER WHILE WE'RE UP HERE IN THE BIG WOODS SAID JERRY SUPPRESSING THE NATURAL TWINGE OF JEALOUSY HE FELT WE OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED WITH OUR BAG AND WILL IS JUST WILD OVER THE BULLY PICTURES HE'S ACCUMULATING EVERY DAY AND NIGHT
7800-283492-0034 IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH HE HAD MET WITH NOTHING BUT SUCCESS SO FAR FRANK ADMITTED I HOPE HE GETS THAT PRIZE THE RAILROADS ARE OFFERING SO FAR AS I CAN TELL HE HAS A DANDY COLLECTION ALREADY AND WE'VE GOT SOME TIME AHEAD OF US STILL BY THE WAY WHERE IS WILL NOW ASKED BLUFF
7800-283492-0035 ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO HE TOLD ME HE WAS GOING OFF TO THE PLACE WHERE WE DISCOVERED THAT COMICAL COLONY OF SQUIRRELS THAT AMUSED US YESTERDAY FRANK EXPLAINED HE HOPED BY KEEPING AS STILL AS A MOUSE TO GET A SNAP AT THEM WHEN THEY WERE CARRYING ON THAT WAY
7800-283492-0036 I THINK MYSELF IT WOULD BE A FINE WOODS PICTURE AND ADD TO HIS COLLECTION SPEAKING OF ANGELS AND YOU'RE MOST SURE TO HEAR THEIR WINGS CHUCKLED JERRY FOR THERE'S WILL COMING THIS WAY NOW AND ON THE RUN TOO ADDED FRANK
7800-283492-0037 HE LOOKS EXCITED FELLOWS I WONDER WHAT HE'S RUN ACROSS NOW WILL WAS ALMOST OUT OF BREATH THEY COULD SEE THAT HIS FACE WAS RED FROM HIS EXERTIONS BUT FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT AS WELL WHILE HIS EYES WERE AS BLUFF EXPRESSED IT
7800-283492-0038 STICKING OUT OF HIS HEAD OH WHAT A WHOPPER HE GASPED AS HE DREW NEAR THE SPOT WHERE THEY STOOD WHAT'S THAT DEMANDED FRANK WONDERING WHAT WAS COMING NOW AND SUCH TRE MENDOUS HORNS TOO CONTINUED WILL
7800-283492-0039 INVOLUNTARILY STRETCHING OUT BOTH HANDS UNTIL HE HAD THEM WIDE APART HORNS WILL BLUFF FIRED AT HIM COWS HAVE HORNS DEER CARRY ANTLERS I SAID HORNS DIDN'T I ASSERTED THE OTHER WITH DETERMINATION
7800-283492-0040 BUT I SNAPPED HIM BEFORE HE TURNED AND TROTTED OFF WHAT TROTTED OFF SHRILLED BLUFF
7800-283493-0000 THE BIG MOOSE A BULL MOOSE YOU SAY WILL ECHOED BLUFF HIS FACE LIGHTING UP WITH SUDDEN ENERGY THAT'S WHAT I MEAN REPLIED THE OTHER I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING BLUFF AND THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW A BULL MOOSE IF I SAW ONE
7800-283493-0001 BUT YOU'RE AWAY OFF IN YOUR GUESS I'VE SO LONGED TO MEET UP WITH ONE WHEN I HAD MY CAMERA WITH ME THAT I'VE BEEN PICTURING HOW HE'D LOOK AND FRANK BELIEVE ME IT WAS A BEAUT A REGULAR MONSTER HOW DID IT HAPPEN WILL ASKED FRANK
7800-283493-0002 I WAS SITTING AS STILL AS ANYTHING THE OTHER RELATED AFTER I'D GOT TWO DANDY SNAPS AT THAT FUNNY SQUIRREL FAMILY PLAYING AROUND THE TREE WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR HOME AND WAS HOPING FOR ANOTHER WHACK AT THEM TO COMPLETE THE SET WHEN ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A WHIFFING SOUND
7800-283493-0003 BUT GO ON WILL WHAT HAPPENED NEXT OH I LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT HAD MADE THAT QUEER SOUND AND THERE HE WAS JUST STANDING AND LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME I WAS NEARLY SCARED TO DEATH AT FIRST FOR HE LOOKED NEARLY AS BIG AS A BARN
7800-283493-0004 THEN I KNEW IT MUST BE A BULL MOOSE AND THE NEXT THING I FOUND MYSELF TAKING HIS PICTURE DID HE RUN AWAY THEN ASKED FRANK TURNED AND TROTTED OFF AS IF HE DIDN'T CARE WHETHER SCHOOL KEPT OR NOT WILL CONTINUED I EVEN HAD THE NERVE TO SHOOT HIM AGAIN AS HE WAS GOING
7800-283493-0005 AND DON'T I HOPE THAT FIRST PICTURE TURNS OUT GOOD IT WAS A REMARKABLE POSE IF ONLY THE FOCUS WAS RIGHT HE STARTED TOWARD THE CABIN DOOR AS THOUGH ANXIOUS TO DEVELOP HIS ROLL OF FILM AND DISCOVER WHAT SUCCESS HIS LABOR HAD RESULTED IN
7800-283493-0006 BLUFF CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARM WAIT JUST A MINUTE OR TWO WILL HE PLEADED TELL US SOME MORE WHERE DID ALL THIS HAPPEN FRANK KNOWS WHERE THAT SQUIRREL COLONY HAVE THEIR NEST IN THE TREE THAT'S GOT A HOLE IN THE TRUNK ABOUT THIRTY FEET UP THE OTHER REPLIED
7800-283493-0007 THAT NEAR THE CAMP IF ONLY YOU'LL HOLD YOUR HORSES UNTIL I CAN DEVELOP THIS FILM YOU SHALL SEE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER I KNOW A STAG FROM A BULL MOOSE HE WAS TOLD BY THE INDIGNANT PHOTOGRAPHER AS THE LATTER BROKE AWAY AND VANISHED INSIDE THE CABIN
7800-283493-0008 HE DID NOT FEEL THAT THEY COULD ENTIRELY DEPEND ON THE EVIDENCE OF WILL WHO MAY HAVE BEEN SO STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN COMING OF SOME ANIMAL THAT HIS IMAGINATION WORKED OVERTIME I HOPE IT WASN'T JUST A MULE THAT STRAYED AWAY FROM SOME LUMBER CAMP HE TOLD THE OTHERS
7800-283493-0009 AS THEY HURRIED OFF BUT NOT BEFORE BLUFF AND JERRY HAD DARTED INSIDE THE CABIN AND REAPPEARED CARRYING THEIR GUNS
7800-283493-0010 BLUFF ADMITTED BUT THEN WILL VOWS IT HAD HORNS TERRIBLY BIG HORNS WHICH NO MULE I EVER SAW COULD BOAST OF OWNING WELL CHANCES ARE IT WAS A BULL MOOSE FRANK ADMITTED BUT WE'LL SOON KNOW

7800-283493-0012 AND I THINK I EVEN SAW A SQUIRREL FRISK OUT OF SIGHT AS WE CAME UP YES AND HERE'S WHERE WILL MADE HIMSELF A SEAT ADDED BLUFF HE FIXED IT SO HE COULD SIT COMFORTABLY AND NOT HAVE TO FRIGHTEN THE FAMILY OF BUSHY TAILS BY MOVING
7800-283493-0013 YES SAID JERRY WHICH WOULD MAKE IT OVER THERE THAT THE THING SHOWED UP LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE GROUND AND SEE IF WILL WAS DREAMING OR NOT BEFORE HALF A MINUTE HAD PASSED FRANK WAS POINTING TO CERTAIN MARKS PLAINLY SEEN IN THE INCH AND MORE OF SNOW THAT HAD FALLEN ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
7800-283493-0014 PERHAPS AS A SORT OF FORERUNNER OF THE COMING STORM THERE YOU ARE FELLOWS HE ANNOUNCED ALL STARED HARD AT THE MONSTROUS TRACKS BLUFF EVEN GOT DOWN ON HANDS AND KNEES IN ORDER TO SEE BETTER IT WAS A MOOSE ALL RIGHT FRANK SAID JERRY
7800-283493-0015 I'M BEGINNING TO BELIEVE WILL WAS NOT SO FAR OUT OF THE WAY AFTER ALL WHEN HE SAID IT MIGHT BE THE GIANT OF ALL MAINE MOOSE BLUFF GOT UP AGAIN SHAKING HIS HEAD OH THE MEANEST LUCK THAT EVER WAS HE LAMENTED
7800-283493-0016 WHY COULDN'T I HAVE TAKEN A NOTION TO STEP OUT HERE WITH WILL TO WATCH THE WAY HE TOOK THE PICTURES OF THAT SQUIRREL FAMILY I'D HAVE HAD MY GUN ACROSS MY KNEES WITH BUCKSHOT IN EVERY SHELL OF COURSE THINK HOW

7800-283493-0020 FOR UP TO NOW HE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN MUCH OF A CHANCE TO BRING DOWN ANY BIG GAME ON THIS TRIP AND WAS SECRETLY CHAFING
7800-283493-0021 THE SOONER THE BETTER SO AS TO KEEP HIS LEAD CUT DOWN AS MUCH AS WE CAN HE WAS TOLD BY BLUFF AFTER WHICH THEY BOTH TURNED TOWARD FRANK FOR AFTER ALL IT WOULD BE FROM THIS QUARTER THAT THE SIGNAL TO START MUST EVENTUALLY COME
7800-283493-0022 NO NEED OF RUSHING OFF AS THOUGH YOU WERE CRAZY FRANK TOLD THEM WILL SAYS THE MOOSE DIDN'T ACT AS THOUGH IT WAS BADLY FRIGHTENED BY SEEING HIM
