481-123720-0049 NOT TO PAY HIM WAS IMPOSSIBLE CONSIDERING HIS CHARACTER BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT FELLOW ABOUT THAT PLAGUE OF MINE ANOTHER TIME HOWEVER I KNEW I SHOULD GO AND SHOULD NOT PAY HIM HIS WAGES THAT NIGHT I HAD THE MOST HIDEOUS DREAMS
481-123720-0050 I WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL BY DISTANT RELATIONS UPON WHOM I WAS DEPENDENT AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE THEY SENT ME THERE A FORLORN SILENT BOY ALREADY CRUSHED BY THEIR REPROACHES ALREADY TROUBLED BY DOUBT
481-123720-0051 AND LOOKING WITH SAVAGE DISTRUST AT EVERYONE MY SCHOOLFELLOWS MET ME WITH SPITEFUL AND MERCILESS JIBES BECAUSE I WAS NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR TAUNTS
481-123720-0052 I COULD NOT GIVE IN TO THEM WITH THE IGNOBLE READINESS WITH WHICH THEY GAVE IN TO ONE ANOTHER I HATED THEM FROM THE FIRST AND SHUT MYSELF AWAY FROM EVERYONE IN TIMID WOUNDED AND DISPROPORTIONATE PRIDE
481-123720-0053 THEIR COARSENESS REVOLTED ME THEY LAUGHED CYNICALLY AT MY FACE AT MY CLUMSY FIGURE AND YET WHAT STUPID FACES THEY HAD THEMSELVES IN OUR SCHOOL THE BOYS FACES SEEMED IN A SPECIAL WAY TO DEGENERATE AND GROW STUPIDER
481-123720-0054 HOW MANY FINE LOOKING BOYS CAME TO US IN A FEW YEARS THEY BECAME REPULSIVE EVEN AT SIXTEEN I WONDERED AT THEM MOROSELY EVEN THEN I WAS STRUCK BY THE PETTINESS OF THEIR THOUGHTS THE STUPIDITY OF THEIR PURSUITS
481-123720-0055 THEIR GAMES THEIR CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD NO UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH ESSENTIAL THINGS THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN SUCH STRIKING IMPRESSIVE SUBJECTS THAT I COULD NOT HELP CONSIDERING THEM INFERIOR TO MYSELF
481-123720-0056 IT WAS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THAT DROVE ME TO IT AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT THRUST UPON ME YOUR HACKNEYED REMARKS REPEATED TO NAUSEA THAT I WAS ONLY A DREAMER WHILE THEY EVEN THEN HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE
481-123720-0057 THEY TOOK RANK FOR INTELLIGENCE EVEN AT SIXTEEN THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT A SNUG BERTH OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS DUE TO THEIR STUPIDITY TO THE BAD EXAMPLES WITH WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD
481-123720-0058 THEY WERE MONSTROUSLY DEPRAVED OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT TOO WAS SUPERFICIAL AND AN ASSUMPTION OF CYNICISM OF COURSE THERE WERE GLIMPSES OF YOUTH AND FRESHNESS EVEN IN THEIR DEPRAVITY BUT EVEN THAT FRESHNESS WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE
481-123720-0059 AND SHOWED ITSELF IN A CERTAIN RAKISHNESS I HATED THEM HORRIBLY THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM THEY REPAID ME IN THE SAME WAY AND DID NOT CONCEAL THEIR AVERSION FOR ME BUT BY THEN I DID NOT DESIRE THEIR AFFECTION
481-123720-0060 ON THE CONTRARY I CONTINUALLY LONGED FOR THEIR HUMILIATION TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR DERISION I PURPOSELY BEGAN TO MAKE ALL THE PROGRESS I COULD WITH MY STUDIES AND FORCED MY WAY TO THE VERY TOP THIS IMPRESSED THEM
481-123720-0061 MOREOVER THEY ALL BEGAN BY DEGREES TO GRASP THAT I HAD ALREADY READ BOOKS NONE OF THEM COULD READ AND UNDERSTOOD THINGS NOT FORMING PART OF OUR SCHOOL CURRICULUM OF WHICH THEY HAD NOT EVEN HEARD THEY TOOK A SAVAGE AND SARCASTIC VIEW OF IT
481-123720-0062 BUT WERE MORALLY IMPRESSED ESPECIALLY AS THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO NOTICE ME ON THOSE GROUNDS THE MOCKERY CEASED BUT THE HOSTILITY REMAINED AND COLD AND STRAINED RELATIONS BECAME PERMANENT BETWEEN US IN THE END I COULD NOT PUT UP WITH IT
481-123720-0063 WITH YEARS A CRAVING FOR SOCIETY FOR FRIENDS DEVELOPED IN ME I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH SOME OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER MY INTIMACY WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS STRAINED AND SOON ENDED OF ITSELF
481-123720-0064 ONCE INDEED I DID HAVE A FRIEND
481-123720-0065 AND REPULSED HIM AS THOUGH ALL I NEEDED HIM FOR WAS TO WIN A VICTORY OVER HIM TO SUBJUGATE HIM AND NOTHING ELSE BUT I COULD NOT SUBJUGATE ALL OF THEM MY FRIEND WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THEM EITHER HE WAS IN FACT A RARE EXCEPTION
481-123720-0066 THE FIRST THING I DID ON LEAVING SCHOOL WAS TO GIVE UP THE SPECIAL JOB FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN DESTINED SO AS TO BREAK ALL TIES
481-123720-0067 AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHY AFTER ALL THAT I SHOULD GO TRUDGING OFF TO SIMONOV'S EARLY NEXT MORNING I ROUSED MYSELF AND JUMPED OUT OF BED WITH EXCITEMENT AS THOUGH IT WERE ALL ABOUT TO HAPPEN AT ONCE
481-123720-0068 BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
481-123720-0069 I WENT TO THE OFFICE HOWEVER AS USUAL BUT SNEAKED AWAY HOME TWO HOURS EARLIER TO GET READY THE GREAT THING I THOUGHT IS NOT TO BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE OR THEY WILL THINK I AM OVERJOYED AT COMING BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SUCH
481-123720-0070 AND THEY ALL AGITATED AND OVERWHELMED ME I POLISHED MY BOOTS A SECOND TIME WITH MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE INDUCED APOLLON TO CLEAN THEM TWICE A DAY AS HE CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN HIS DUTIES REQUIRED OF HIM
481-123720-0071 I STOLE THE BRUSHES TO CLEAN THEM FROM THE PASSAGE BEING CAREFUL HE SHOULD NOT DETECT IT FOR FEAR OF HIS CONTEMPT
481-123720-0072 I HAD LET MYSELF GET TOO SLOVENLY MY UNIFORM PERHAPS WAS TIDY BUT I COULD NOT GO OUT TO DINNER IN MY UNIFORM THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT ON THE KNEE OF MY TROUSERS WAS A BIG YELLOW STAIN
481-123720-0073 I HAD A FOREBODING THAT THAT STAIN WOULD DEPRIVE ME OF NINE TENTHS OF MY PERSONAL DIGNITY I KNEW TOO THAT IT WAS VERY POOR TO THINK SO BUT THIS IS NO TIME FOR THINKING NOW I AM IN FOR THE REAL THING I THOUGHT AND MY HEART SANK
481-123720-0074 I KNEW TOO PERFECTLY WELL EVEN THEN THAT I WAS MONSTROUSLY EXAGGERATING THE FACTS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT
481-123720-0075 WITH DESPAIR I PICTURED TO MYSELF HOW COLDLY AND DISDAINFULLY THAT SCOUNDREL ZVERKOV WOULD MEET ME
481-123720-0076 WITH WHAT IMPUDENT RUDENESS THE INSECT FERFITCHKIN WOULD SNIGGER AT ME IN ORDER TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH ZVERKOV HOW COMPLETELY SIMONOV WOULD TAKE IT ALL IN AND HOW HE WOULD DESPISE ME FOR THE ABJECTNESS OF MY VANITY AND LACK OF SPIRIT
481-123720-0077 AND WORST OF ALL HOW PALTRY UNLITERARY COMMONPLACE IT WOULD ALL BE
481-123720-0078 BUT THAT WAS MOST IMPOSSIBLE OF ALL IF I FEEL IMPELLED TO DO ANYTHING I SEEM TO BE PITCHFORKED INTO IT I SHOULD HAVE JEERED AT MYSELF EVER AFTERWARDS SO YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED THE REAL THING
481-123720-0079 ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
481-123720-0080 OF DOMINATING THEM CARRYING THEM AWAY MAKING THEM LIKE ME IF ONLY FOR MY ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND UNMISTAKABLE WIT THEY WOULD ABANDON ZVERKOV HE WOULD SIT ON ONE SIDE SILENT AND ASHAMED WHILE I SHOULD CRUSH HIM THEN PERHAPS
481-123720-0081 WE WOULD BE RECONCILED AND DRINK TO OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP BUT WHAT WAS MOST BITTER AND HUMILIATING FOR ME WAS THAT I KNEW EVEN THEN KNEW FULLY AND FOR CERTAIN THAT I NEEDED NOTHING OF ALL THIS REALLY THAT I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO CRUSH
481-123720-0082 TO SUBDUE TO ATTRACT THEM
481-123720-0083 OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
481-123720-0084 OPENED THE MOVABLE PANE AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE TROUBLED DARKNESS OF THE THICKLY FALLING WET SNOW AT LAST MY WRETCHED LITTLE CLOCK HISSED OUT FIVE I SEIZED MY HAT AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT APOLLON
481-123720-0085 WHO HAD BEEN ALL DAY EXPECTING HIS MONTH'S WAGES BUT IN HIS FOOLISHNESS WAS UNWILLING TO BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK ABOUT IT I SLIPPED BETWEEN HIM AND THE DOOR AND JUMPING INTO A HIGH CLASS SLEDGE ON WHICH I SPENT MY LAST HALF ROUBLE
4813-248638-0000 A TOWN OF ENTERPRISE AND CHARACTER EVER SINCE THE FIRST WATER POWER MILL IN THIS COUNTRY THE FIRST POWDER MILL IN THIS COUNTRY THE FIRST CHOCOLATE MILL IN THIS COUNTRY AND THUS THROUGH A WHOLE LINE OF FIRST THINGS THE FIRST VIOLONCELLO
4813-248638-0001 FEW PEOPLE TO DAY THINK OF MILTON IN TERMS OF INDUSTRIAL REPUTE BUT RATHER AS A PLACE OF ESTATES TOO ARISTOCRATIC TO BE FASHIONABLE
4813-248638-0002 AND OF CHARMING WALKS AND DRIVES AND VIEWS MANY OF THE OLD FAMILIES WHO HAVE GIVEN THE TOWN ITS PRESTIGE STILL LIVE IN THEIR ANCESTRAL MANORS AND MANY OF THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE MOVED THERE IN RECENT YEARS
4813-248638-0003 AS THE STRANGER PASSES THROUGH MILTON HE IS CAPTIVATED BY GLIMPSES OF ANCIENT HOMESTEADS SETTLING BEHIND THEIR WHITE COLONIAL FENCES TOPPED WITH WHITE COLONIAL URNS HALF HIDDEN BY THEIR ANTIQUE TREES WITH AN AIR OF COMFORTABLE EASE
4813-248638-0004 OF BREEDING THAT NEITHER PARADES NOR CONCEALS ITS QUALITY YES THIS IS MILTON THIS IS MODERN MILTON BOSTON SOCIETY RECEIVES SOME OF ITS MOST PROMINENT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THIS PATRICIAN SOURCE
4813-248638-0005 BUT MODERN MILTON IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS AS OLD MILTON
4813-248638-0006 THAT SWIMS FOREVER AGAINST THE SKY THAT MARCHES FOREVER AROUND THE HORIZON THE ROUNDED SUMMITS OF THE BLUE HILLS TO WHICH THE EYE IS IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED BEFORE ENTERING THE TOWN WHICH PRINCIPALLY CLAIMS THEM ARE THE WORN DOWN STUMPS OF ANCIENT MOUNTAINS
4813-248638-0007 AND ALTHOUGH SO LEVELED BY THE PROCESS OF THE AGES THEY ARE STILL THE HIGHEST LAND NEAR THE COAST FROM MAINE TO MEXICO THESE EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY SKYEY CRESTS FORM THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE SO CALLED BOSTON BASIN
4813-248638-0008 AND ARE THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE SOUTHERN COAST FROM THEM THE MASSACHUSET TRIBE ABOUT THE BAY DERIVED ITS NAME SIGNIFYING NEAR THE GREAT HILLS WHICH NAME WAS CHANGED BY THE ENGLISH TO MASSACHUSETTS
4813-248638-0009 AND APPLIED TO BOTH BAY AND COLONY ALTHOUGH ITS INDIAN NAME HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM THIS LOVELY RANGE THE LOVELINESS REMAINS ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY SHIMMERS UNDER THE MYSTERIOUS BLOOM OF THESE HEIGHTS
4813-248638-0010 SO VAST THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS DWARFED BESIDE THEM AND YET SO CURIOUSLY AIRY THAT THEY SEEM TO PERPETUALLY RIPPLE AGAINST THE SKY THE GREAT BLUE HILL ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHICH BEARS AN OBSERVATORY ON ITS SUMMIT SWIMS ABOVE ONE'S HEAD
4813-248638-0011 IT SEEMS TO HAVE A SINGULAR WAY OF MOVING FROM POINT TO POINT AS ONE MOTORS AND ALTHOUGH ONE MAY BE FORCED TO ADMIT THAT THIS MAY BE DUE MORE TO THE WINDING ROADS THAN TO THE ILLUSIVENESS OF THE HILL STILL THE BUOYANT EFFECT IS THE SAME
4813-248638-0012 RUSKIN DECLARES SOMEWHERE WITH HIS QUAINT AND CHARACTERISTIC MIXTURE OF POSITIVENESS AND IDEALISM THAT INHABITANTS OF GRANITE COUNTRIES
4813-248638-0013 THAT CLEARLY DISTINGUISHES THEM FROM THE INHABITANTS OF LESS PURE DISTRICTS PERHAPS HE WAS RIGHT FOR SURELY HERE
4813-248638-0014 EACH HAS THROUGH ITS OWN FAIR NAME DONE HONOR TO THE FAIR NAMES WHICH HAVE PRECEDED IT ONE OF THE VERY FIRST TO BE ATTRACTED BY THE LOFTY AND YET LOVELY APPEAL OF THIS REGION WAS GOVERNOR THOMAS HUTCHINSON
4813-248638-0015 AND THE WIDE FLAT TWIST OF THE NEPONSET RIVER WINDING THROUGH IT FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A DECORATIVE PANEL
4813-248638-0016 THIS IS THE VIEW THAT THE GOVERNOR SO ADMIRED AND TRADITION TELLS US
4813-248638-0017 HE WALKED ON FOOT DOWN THE HILL SHAKING HANDS WITH HIS NEIGHBORS PATRIOT AND TORY ALIKE WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES AS HE LEFT BEHIND HIM THE GARDEN AND THE TREES HE HAD PLANTED AND THE HOUSE WHERE HE HAD SO HAPPILY LIVED
4813-248638-0018 THE VIEW FROM THE BACK HOLDS EVEN MORE INTIMATE ATTRACTION HERE IS THE OLD OLD GARDEN AND ALTHOUGH THE EPHEMERAL BLOSSOMS OF THE PRESENT SPRINGTIME SHINE BRIGHTLY FORTH THE BOX FULL TWENTY FEET HIGH SPEAKS OF ANOTHER EPOCH
4813-248638-0019 THAT VISITORS ON ENTERING FROM THE STREET MIGHT SEE THE GLEAM OF HIS GOLD KNEE BUCKLES AS HE STOOD ON THE DISTANT PORCH THE AVENUE HOWEVER WAS NEVER COMPLETED AS BELCHER WAS APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF AND TRANSFERRED TO NEW JERSEY SHORTLY AFTER
4813-248638-0020 TWO OTHER MEN OF NOTE WHO SINCE THE DAYS OF OUR YEARS ARE BUT THREESCORE AND TEN CHOSE THAT THEIR DAYS WITHOUT NUMBER SHOULD BE SPENT IN THE TOWN THEY LOVED WERE WENDELL PHILLIPS AND RIMMER THE SCULPTOR WHO ARE BOTH BURIED AT MILTON
4813-248638-0021 NOT ONLY NOTABLE PERSONAGES BUT NOTABLE EVENTS HAVE BEEN ENGENDERED UNDER THE SHADOW OF THESE HILLS THE SUFFOLK RESOLVES WHICH WERE THE PRELUDE OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WERE ADOPTED AT THE VOSE HOUSE
4813-248638-0022 STILL RETAINS IN ITS BROAD HOSPITABLE LINES SOME SHRED OF ITS ANCIENT CHARM MILTON IS FULL OF HISTORY FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY DAYS WHEN THE CANNONADING AT BUNKER HILL SHOOK THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE HOUSES BUT NOT THE NERVES OF THE MILTON LADIES
4813-248638-0023 WHEN THE FOURTH LIBERTY LOAN OF TWO MILLION NINE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS SUBSCRIBED FROM A POPULATION OF NINE THOUSAND ALL THE VARIOUS VICISSITUDES OF PEACE AND WAR HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED ON THE HIGH LEVEL
4813-248638-0024 THAT ONE MIGHT EXPECT FROM MEN AND WOMEN NOBLY NURTURED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE HILLS HOW MUCH OF ITS SUCCESS MILTON ATTRIBUTES TO ITS LOCATION FOR ONE JOINS INDEED A DISTINGUISHED FELLOWSHIP WHEN ONE BUILDS UPON A HILL
4813-248638-0025 OR ON SEVERAL HILLS AS ROMAN AS WELL AS BOSTONIAN HISTORY TESTIFIES CAN ONLY BE GUESSED BY ITS TRIBUTE IN THE FORM OF THE BLUE HILLS RESERVATION THIS STATE RECREATION PARK AND FOREST RESERVE
4813-248638-0026 OF ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND ACRES A LABYRINTH OF IDYLLIC FOOTPATHS AND LEAFY TRAILS OF TWISTING DRIVES AND WALKS THAT OPEN OUT UPON SUPERB VISTAS IS NOW THE PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS THE GRANITE QUARRY MAN
4813-248638-0027 FAR MORE INTERESTED IN THE VALUE OF THE STONE THAT UNDERLAY THE WOODED SLOPES THAN IN RUSKIN'S THEORY OF ITS PURIFYING EFFECT UPON THE INHABITANTS HAD ALREADY OBTAINED A FOOTING HERE WHEN UNDER THE ABLE LEADERSHIP OF CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS
4813-248638-0028 THE WHOLE REGION WAS TAKEN OVER BY THE STATE IN EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR AS YOU PASS THROUGH THE RESERVATION AND IF YOU ARE TAKING EVEN THE MOST CURSORY GLIMPSE OF MILTON YOU MUST INCLUDE SOME PORTION OF THIS PARK
4813-248638-0029 THE RACE TRACK WITH ITS JUDGES STANDS IS STILL THERE BUT THERE ARE NO MORE HORSE RACES ALTHOUGH THE FORBES FAMILY STILL HOLDS A CONSPICUOUS PLACE
4813-248638-0030 YOU MAY SEE TOO A SOLITARY FIGURE WITH A SCIENTIST'S STOOP OR A TUTOR WITH A GROUP OF BOYS MAKING A FIRST HAND STUDY OF A REGION WHICH IS FULL OF INTEREST TO THE GEOLOGIST CIRCLING THUS AROUND THE BASE OF THE GREAT BLUE HILL
4813-248638-0031 ERECTED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY THE LATE A LAWRENCE ROTCH OF MILTON WHO BEQUEATHED FUNDS FOR ITS MAINTENANCE IT IS NOW CONNECTED WITH HARVARD UNIVERSITY
4813-248638-0032 ONCE AT THE TOP THE EYE IS OVERWHELMED BY A CIRCUIT OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES IT IS ALMOST TOO IMMENSE AT FIRST ALMOST AS BARREN AS AN EMPTY EXPANSE OF ROLLING GREEN SEA BUT AS THE EYE GROWS ACCUSTOMED TO THE STRETCHING DISTANCES
4813-248638-0033 OBJECTS BOTH NEAR AND FAR BEGIN TO APPEAR AND SOON IF THE DAY IS CLEAR BUILDINGS MAY BE IDENTIFIED IN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE VILLAGES WE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE SEA ON THE HIGHEST COASTLAND
4813-248638-0034 FROM AGAMENTICUS NEAR YORK MAINE TO THE RIO GRANDE AND THE PANORAMA THUS UNROLLED IS TRULY MAGNIFICENT FACING NORTHERLY WE CAN EASILY DISTINGUISH CAMBRIDGE SOMERVILLE AND MALDEN
4813-248638-0035 AND FAR BEYOND THE HILLS OF ANDOVER AND GEORGETOWN A LITTLE TO THE EAST BOSTON WITH ITS GILDED DOME THEN THE HARBOR WITH ITS ISLANDS HEADLANDS AND FORTIFICATIONS
4813-248638-0036 AS FAR AS EASTERN POINT LIGHTHOUSE IN GLOUCESTER FORTY MILES TO THE NORTHEAST APPEAR THE TWIN LIGHTHOUSES ON THATCHER'S ISLAND SEEMING FROM HERE TO BE STANDING NOT ON THE LAND BUT OUT IN THE OCEAN
4813-248638-0037 WHILE BEYOND IT STRETCHES MASSACHUSETTS BAY TURNING NEARLY EAST THE EYE PASSING OVER CHICKATAWBUT HILL THREE MILES OFF AND SECOND IN HEIGHT OF THE BLUE HILLS FOLLOWS THE BEAUTIFUL CURVE OF NANTASKET BEACH
4813-248638-0038 AND THE POINTING FINGER OF MINOT'S LIGHT FACING NEARLY SOUTH THE LONG RIDGE OF MANOMET HILL IN PLYMOUTH THIRTY THREE MILES AWAY STANDS CLEAR AGAINST THE SKY WHILE TWENTY SIX MILES AWAY IN DUXBURY ONE SEES THE MYLES STANDISH MONUMENT
4813-248638-0039 AND FAR BEYOND IT IS THE GRAND MONADNOCK IN JAFFREY
4813-248638-0040 WITH ITS TWO EQUAL SUMMITS THE NEXT GROUP TO THE RIGHT IS IN LYNDEBORO AT THE RIGHT OF LYNDEBORO AND NEARLY OVER THE READVILLE RAILROAD STATIONS IS JOE ENGLISH HILL AND TO COMPLETE THE ROUND NEARLY NORTH NORTHWEST ARE THE SUMMITS
4813-248638-0041 OF THE UNCANOONUC MOUNTAINS FIFTY NINE MILES AWAY THIS THEN IS THE GREAT BLUE HILL OF MILTON THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW ENGLAND CAN STAND HERE AND PICK OUT A HUNDRED DISTINGUISHING LANDMARKS
4813-248638-0042 AND THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE MAY FIND AN UNPARALLELED OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE WHOLE REGION AT ONE SWEEP OF THE EYE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF TOPOGRAPHY THE SUMMIT OF GREAT BLUE HILL IS THE PLACE TO REACH BUT FOR THE SENSE OF MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY
4813-248638-0043 THE HILL ITSELF SEEN FROM A DISTANCE FLOATING LIGHTLY LIKE A VAST BLUE BALL AGAINST A VASTER SKY IS DREAMILY SUGGESTIVE IN A WAY WHICH THE ACTUAL VIEW SUPERB AS IT IS IS NOT
4813-248638-0044 ONE REMEMBERS STEVENSON'S OBSERVATION THAT SOMETIMES TO TRAVEL HOPEFULLY IS BETTER THAN TO ARRIVE SO LET US COME DOWN FOR AFTER ALL LOVE IS OF THE VALLEY DOWN AGAIN TO THE OLD TOWN OF MILTON
4813-248638-0045 WE HAVE NOT HALF BEGUN TO WANDER OVER IT NOT HALF BEGUN TO HEAR THE PLEASANT STORIES IT HAS TO TELL WHEN ONE IS AS OLD AS THIS FOR MILTON WAS DISCOVERED BY A BAND FROM PLYMOUTH WHO CAME UP THE NEPONSET RIVER IN SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE
4813-248638-0046 WHICH DRIFTS TO US WITH A TURN OF THE WIND COMES FROM A CHOCOLATE MILL WHOSE TRADE MARK OF A NEAT HANDED MAID WITH HER LITTLE TRAY IS KNOWN ALL OVER THE CIVILIZED WORLD
4813-248638-0047 AND THOSE MILLS STAND UPON THE SITE OF THE FIRST GRIST MILL IN NEW ENGLAND TO BE RUN BY WATER POWER THIS WAS IN SIXTEEN THIRTY FOUR AND ONE LIKES TO PICTURE THE STURDY COLONISTS TRAILING INTO TOWN THEIR PACKS UPON THEIR BACKS
4813-248638-0048 LIKE CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN GAMES TO HAVE THEIR GRAIN GROUND ISRAEL STOUGHTON WAS THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO ESTABLISHED THIS FIRST MILL A NAME PERPETUATED
4813-248638-0049 ALL GROUND IS HISTORIC GROUND IN MILTON THAT ROLLICKING GROUP OF SCHOOLBOYS YONDER BELONGS TO AN ACADEMY WHICH HANDSOME AND FLOURISHING AS IT IS TO DAY WAS FOUNDED AS LONG AGO AS SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
4813-248638-0050 SET AGAINST A STONE WALL NEAR ITS ORIGINAL SITE THIS EARLY CHURCH AND EARLY SCHOOL WAS A LOG CABIN WITH A THATCHED ROOF AND LATTICED WINDOWS IF ONE MAY BELIEVE THE RELIEF
4813-248638-0051 BUT MEN OF BRAINS AND CHARACTER WERE TAUGHT THERE LESSONS WHICH STOOD THEM AND THE COLONY IN GOOD STEAD ONE FANCIES THE STUDENTS ROVING EYES MAY HAVE OCCASIONALLY STRAYED DOWN THE INDIAN TRAIL DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE OLD SITE A TRAIL WHICH
4813-248638-0052 ALTHOUGH NOW ATTAINED TO THE PROUD RANK OF A LANE CHURCHILL'S LANE STILL INVITES ONE DOWN ITS TANGLED GREEN WAY ALONG THE GRAY STONE WALL YES EVERY STEP OF GROUND HAS ITS TRADITION HERE
4813-248638-0053 YONDER RAILROAD TRACK MARKS THE SPOT WHERE THE VERY FIRST TIE IN THE COUNTRY WAS LAID AND LAID FOR NO LESS SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE THAN TO FACILITATE THE CARRYING OF GRANITE BLOCKS FOR BUNKER HILL MONUMENT FROM THEIR QUARRY TO THE HARBOR GRANITE FROM THE HILLS
4813-248638-0054 AGAIN WE ARE DRAWN BACK TO THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNET OF THOSE MIGHTY MONITORS YES WHEREVER ONE GOES IN MILTON EITHER ON FOOT TO DAY OR BACK THROUGH THE CHAPTERS OF THREE CENTURIES AGO THE BLUE HILLS DOMINATE EVERY EVENT
4813-248638-0055 AND THE GREAT BLUE HILL FLOATS ABOVE THEM ALL
4813-248641-0000 MANY OF THE CARS ARE MODERATELY PRICED AFFAIRS THE TONNEAU WELL FILLED WITH CHILDREN OF MISCELLANEOUS AGES AND ENLIVENED BY A FAMILY DOG OR TWO FOR THIS IS THE WAY THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD SPENDS ITS MODERN SABBATH HOLIDAY
4813-248641-0001 FOR A ROAD ORIGINALLY MARKED BY THE MOCCASINED FEET OF INDIANS AND WIDENED GRADUALLY BY THE TOILSOME JOURNEYINGS OF ROUGH COLONIAL CARTS AND COACHES
4813-248641-0002 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH FEATURE OF THE STEADILY MOVING TRAVEL WOULD MOST FORCIBLY STRIKE THE ORIGINAL PURITAN SETTLERS OF THE TOWN THE FACT THAT EVEN THE COMMON MAN THE POOR MAN COULD OWN SUCH A VEHICLE OF SPEED AND EASE OR THE FACT THAT AMERICA
4813-248641-0003 SUCH A SHORT TIME AGO A WILDERNESS COULD PRODUCE NOT AS THE FINEST FLOWER ON ITS TREE OF EVOLUTION BUT CERTAINLY AS ITS MOST EXOTIC THE PLUTOCRAT WHO LIVES IN A PALACE WITH FIFTY SERVANTS TO DO HIS BIDDING
4813-248641-0004 AND THE FINE LADY WHOSE SOLE EXERCISE OF HER MENTAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS CONSISTS IN ALLOWING HER MAID TO DRESS HER YES NEW ENGLAND HAS CHANGED AMAZINGLY IN THE REVOLUTIONS OF THREE CENTURIES
4813-248641-0005 AND HERE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THIS SQUARE PLAIN BUILDING HINGHAM'S OLD SHIP CHURCH WHILE WE PAUSE TO WATCH THE SUNDAY PAGEANT OF NINETEEN TWENTY WE CAN MOST EASILY CALL BACK THE SABBATH RITES AND THE IDEALS WHICH CREATED THOSE RITES
4813-248641-0006 THIS WOODEN MEETING HOUSE WITH THE TRUNCATED PYRAMIDAL ROOF AND BELFRY TO SERVE AS A LOOKOUT STATION HAS JUST BEEN BUILT A STAGE AHEAD ARCHITECTURALLY OF THE LOG MEETING HOUSE WITH CLAY FILLED CHINKS THATCHED ROOF OILED PAPER WINDOWS
