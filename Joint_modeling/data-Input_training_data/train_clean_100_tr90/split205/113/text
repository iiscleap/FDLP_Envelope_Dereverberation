4397-15668-0031 HE SAID THEY ARE NICE
4397-15668-0032 ARE TWO SPECIES OF ZIGADENAS FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA
4397-15668-0033 AND THREE OR FOUR HANDSOME ALLIUMS ONE OF THESE LILIES THE CALOCHORTUS SEVERAL SPECIES OF WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN IN CALIFORNIA AS THE MARIPOSA TULIPS HAS RECEIVED GREAT CONSIDERATION AT THE HANDS OF THE MORMONS
4397-15668-0034 FOR TO IT HUNDREDS OF THEM OWE THEIR LIVES DURING THE FAMINE YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT GREAT DESTITUTION PREVAILED ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN SETTLEMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF DROUTH AND GRASSHOPPERS
4397-15668-0035 AND THROUGHOUT ONE HUNGRY WINTER IN PARTICULAR THOUSANDS OF THE PEOPLE SUBSISTED CHIEFLY ON THE BULBS OF THE TULIPS CALLED SEGO BY THE INDIANS WHO TAUGHT THEM ITS USE LILIACEOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE RARE AMONG THE MORMONS
4397-15668-0036 OFTEN CURIOUSLY FRECKLED LIKE THE PETALS OF FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA THEY ARE FRUIT RATHER THAN FLOWER GOOD BROWN BREAD BUT DOWN IN THE SAN PITCH VALLEY AT GUNNISON I DISCOVERED A GENUINE LILY HAPPILY NAMED LILY YOUNG
4397-15668-0037 SHE IS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF BRIGHAM YOUNG SLENDER AND GRACEFUL WITH LILY WHITE CHEEKS TINTED WITH CLEAR ROSE SHE WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE OLD SALT LAKE ZION HOUSE BUT BY SOME STRANGE CHANCE
4397-15668-0038 HAS BEEN TRANSPLANTED TO THIS WILDERNESS WHERE SHE BLOOMS ALONE THE LILY OF SAN PITCH PITCH IS AN OLD INDIAN WHO I SUPPOSE PITCHED INTO THE SETTLERS AND THUS ACQUIRED FAME ENOUGH TO GIVE NAME TO THE VALLEY
4397-15668-0039 HERE I FEEL UNEASY ABOUT THE NAME OF THIS LILY FOR THE COMPOSITORS HAVE A PERVERSE TRICK OF MAKING ME SAY ALL KINDS OF ABSURD THINGS WHOLLY UNWARRANTED BY PLAIN COPY AND I FEAR THAT THE LILY OF SAN PITCH WILL APPEAR IN PRINT AS THE WIDOW OF SAM PATCH
4397-15678-0000 AS ONE STROLLS IN THE WOODS ABOUT THE LOGGING CAMPS MOST OF THE LUMBERMEN ARE FOUND TO BE INTERESTING PEOPLE TO MEET KIND AND OBLIGING AND SINCERE FULL OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE BARK AND SAPWOOD AND HEARTWOOD OF THE TREES THEY CUT AND HOW TO FELL THEM WITHOUT UNNECESSARY BREAKAGE
4397-15678-0001 A VERY DIFFERENT MAN SEEN NOW AND THEN AT LONG INTERVALS BUT USUALLY INVISIBLE IS THE FREE ROAMER OF THE WILDERNESS HUNTER PROSPECTOR EXPLORER SEEKING HE KNOWS NOT WHAT LITHE AND SINEWY HE WALKS ERECT
4397-15678-0002 MAKING HIS WAY WITH THE SKILL OF WILD ANIMALS ALL HIS SENSES IN ACTION WATCHFUL AND ALERT LOOKING KEENLY AT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT HIS IMAGINATION WELL NOURISHED IN THE WEALTH OF THE WILDERNESS COMING INTO CONTACT WITH FREE NATURE IN A THOUSAND FORMS
4397-15678-0003 HUNGRY AT TIMES AND WEARY HE HAS CORRESPONDING ENJOYMENT IN EATING AND RESTING AND ALL THE WILDERNESS IS HOME SOME OF THESE RARE HAPPY ROVERS DIE ALONE AMONG THE LEAVES
4397-15678-0004 OTHERS HALF SETTLE DOWN AND CHANGE IN PART INTO FARMERS EACH MAKING CHOICE OF SOME FERTILE SPOT WHERE THE LANDSCAPE ATTRACTS HIM BUILDS A SMALL CABIN WHERE WITH FEW WANTS TO SUPPLY FROM GARDEN OR FIELD HE HUNTS AND FARMS IN TURN
4397-15678-0005 UNTIL NIGHT BEGINS TO DRAW NEAR AND LIKE FOREST SHADOWS THICKENS INTO DARKNESS AND HIS DAY IS DONE IN THESE WASHINGTON WILDS LIVING ALONE ALL SORTS OF MEN MAY PERCHANCE BE FOUND POETS PHILOSOPHERS
4397-15678-0006 AND EVEN FULL BLOWN TRANSCENDENTALISTS THOUGH YOU MAY GO FAR TO FIND THEM INDIANS ARE SELDOM TO BE MET WITH AWAY FROM THE SOUND EXCEPTING ABOUT THE FEW OUTLYING HOP RANCHES TO WHICH THEY RESORT IN GREAT NUMBERS DURING THE PICKING SEASON
4397-15678-0007 NOR IN YOUR WALKS IN THE WOODS WILL YOU BE LIKELY TO SEE MANY OF THE WILD ANIMALS HOWEVER FAR YOU MAY GO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL AND THE MOUNTAIN GOAT THE SQUIRREL IS EVERYWHERE AND THE GOAT YOU CAN HARDLY FAIL TO FIND IF YOU CLIMB ANY OF THE HIGH MOUNTAINS THE DEER
4397-15678-0008 TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE BY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND SWIMMING TO THE ISLANDS OFF SHORE THE ELK AND PERHAPS ALSO THE MOOSE STILL EXIST IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE SOLITUDES OF THE FOREST BUT THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GREATLY REDUCED OF LATE
4397-15678-0009 AND EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED HUNTERS HAVE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEM OF BEARS THERE ARE TWO SPECIES THE BLACK AND THE LARGE BROWN THE FORMER BY FAR THE MORE COMMON OF THE TWO ON THE SHAGGY BOTTOM LANDS WHERE BERRIES ARE PLENTIFUL
4397-15678-0010 AND ALONG THE RIVERS WHILE SALMON ARE GOING UP TO SPAWN THE BLACK BEAR MAY BE FOUND FAT AND AT HOME MANY ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BOTH FOR THEIR FLESH AND SKINS THE LARGE BROWN SPECIES LIKES HIGHER AND OPENER GROUND
4397-15678-0011 HE IS A DANGEROUS ANIMAL A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE FAMOUS GRIZZLY AND WISE HUNTERS ARE VERY FOND OF LETTING HIM ALONE THE TOWNS OF PUGET SOUND ARE OF A VERY LIVELY PROGRESSIVE AND ASPIRING KIND
4397-15678-0012 AND THESE TWO ARE KEEN ACTIVE RIVALS TO ALL APPEARANCES WELL MATCHED TACOMA OCCUPIES NEAR THE HEAD OF THE SOUND A SITE OF GREAT NATURAL BEAUTY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD AND CALLS ITSELF THE CITY OF DESTINY
4397-15678-0013 SEATTLE IS ALSO CHARMINGLY LOCATED ABOUT TWENTY MILES DOWN THE SOUND FROM TACOMA ON ELLIOTT BAY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE SEATTLE LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILROAD NOW IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND CALLS ITSELF THE QUEEN CITY OF THE SOUND
4397-15678-0014 AMONG THE TREES AND STUMPS AND BRUSH WHICH HIDE A GOOD MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THE STAKES WHICH MARK THE LOTS SO THAT WITHOUT BEING AS YET VERY LARGE TOWNS THEY SEEM TO FADE AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE
4397-15678-0015 PUTTING ON AIRS AS SOME WOULD SAY LIKE BOYS IN HASTE TO BE MEN THEY ARE ALREADY TOWNS WITH ALL MODERN IMPROVEMENTS FIRST CLASS IN EVERY PARTICULAR AS IS SAID OF HOTELS THEY HAVE ELECTRIC MOTORS AND LIGHTS
4397-15678-0016 PAVED BROADWAYS AND BOULEVARDS SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS BLOCKS SCHOOLS CHURCHES FACTORIES AND FOUNDRIES THE LUSTY TITANIC CLANG OF BOILER MAKING MAY BE HEARD THERE
4397-15678-0017 AND PLENTY OF THE LANGUID MUSIC OF PIANOS MINGLING WITH THE BABEL NOISES OF COMMERCE CARRIED ON IN A HUNDRED TONGUES THE MAIN STREETS ARE CROWDED WITH BRIGHT WIDE AWAKE LAWYERS MINISTERS MERCHANTS AGENTS FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN
4397-15678-0018 OX DRIVERS AND LOGGERS IN STIFF GUMMY OVERALLS BACK SLANTING DUDES WELL TAILORED AND SHINY AND FASHIONS AND BONNETS OF EVERY FEATHER AND COLOR BLOOM GAYLY IN THE NOISY THRONG AND ADVERTISE LONDON AND PARIS
4397-15678-0019 VIGOROUS LIFE AND STRIFE ARE TO BE SEEN EVERYWHERE THE SPIRIT OF PROGRESS IS IN THE AIR STILL IT IS HARD TO REALIZE HOW MUCH GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE HERE OF A KIND THAT MAKES FOR CIVILIZATION THE ENTHUSIASTIC EXULTING ENERGY DISPLAYED IN THE BUILDING OF NEW TOWNS
4397-15678-0020 RAILROADS AND MILLS IN THE OPENING OF MINES OF COAL AND IRON AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN GENERAL TO MANY ESPECIALLY IN THE ATLANTIC STATES WASHINGTON IS HARDLY KNOWN AT ALL IT IS REGARDED AS BEING YET A FAR WILD WEST
4397-15678-0021 A DIM NEBULOUS EXPANSE OF WOODS BY THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW THAT RAILROADS AND STEAMERS HAVE BROUGHT THE COUNTRY OUT OF THE WILDERNESS AND ABOLISHED THE OLD DISTANCES IT IS NOW NEAR TO ALL THE WORLD AND IS IN POSSESSION OF A SHARE OF THE BEST OF ALL THAT CIVILIZATION HAS TO OFFER
4397-15678-0022 WHILE ON SOME OF THE LINES OF ADVANCEMENT IT IS AT THE FRONT NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHARP RIVALRY BETWEEN DIFFERENT SECTIONS AND TOWNS THE LEADING MEN MOSTLY PULL TOGETHER FOR THE GENERAL GOOD AND GLORY
4397-15678-0023 BUILDING BUYING BORROWING TO PUSH THE COUNTRY TO ITS PLACE KEEPING ARITHMETIC BUSY IN COUNTING POPULATION PRESENT AND TO COME SHIPS TOWNS FACTORIES TONS OF COAL AND IRON FEET OF LUMBER MILES OF RAILROAD
4397-15678-0024 THEREFORE HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND HIGH THE BRAG ASCENDING FROM PUGET SOUND IN MOST CASES IT IS LIKELY TO APPEAR PARDONABLE AND MORE SEATTLE WAS NAMED AFTER AN OLD INDIAN CHIEF WHO LIVED IN THIS PART OF THE SOUND
4397-15678-0025 HE WAS VERY PROUD OF THE HONOR AND LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO LEAD HIS GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT THE STREETS THE GREATER PART OF THE LOWER BUSINESS PORTION OF THE TOWN INCLUDING A LONG STRETCH OF WHARVES AND WAREHOUSES BUILT ON PILES
4397-15678-0026 THE PEOPLE HOWEVER ARE IN NO WISE DISCOURAGED AND ERE LONG THE LOSS WILL BE GAIN INASMUCH AS A BETTER CLASS OF BUILDINGS CHIEFLY OF BRICK ARE BEING ERECTED IN PLACE OF THE INFLAMMABLE WOODEN ONES WHICH WITH COMPARATIVELY FEW EXCEPTIONS WERE BUILT OF PITCHY SPRUCE
4397-15678-0027 SOME GO BOATING ON THE SOUND OR ON THE LAKES AND RIVERS OR WITH THEIR FAMILIES MAKE EXCURSIONS AT SMALL COST ON THE STEAMERS OTHERS WILL TAKE THE TRAIN TO THE FRANKLIN AND NEWCASTLE OR CARBON RIVER COAL MINES FOR THE SAKE OF THE THIRTY OR FORTY MILE RIDES THROUGH THE WOODS
4397-15678-0028 AND A LOOK INTO THE BLACK DEPTHS OF THE UNDERWORLD OTHERS AGAIN TAKE THE STEAMERS FOR VICTORIA FRASER RIVER OR VANCOUVER THE NEW AMBITIOUS TOWN AT THE TERMINUS OF THE CANADIAN RAILROAD THUS GETTING VIEWS OF THE OUTER WORLD IN A NEAR FOREIGN COUNTRY
4397-15678-0029 GREEN RIVER IS A SMALL ROCKY STREAM WITH PICTURESQUE BANKS AND DERIVES ITS NAME FROM THE BEAUTIFUL PALE GREEN HUE OF ITS WATERS AMONG THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL THE SUMMER REST AND PLEASURE PLACES IS THE FAMOUS HOP RANCH ON THE UPPER SNOQUALMIE RIVER
4397-15678-0030 THIRTY OR FORTY MILES EASTWARD FROM SEATTLE
4397-15678-0031 HALF PRAIRIE LEVEL AND FERTILE AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSIFIED WITH OUTSTANDING GROVES OF SPRUCES AND ALDERS AND RICH FLOWERY FRINGES OF SPIRAEA AND WILD ROSES THE RIVER MEANDERING DEEP AND TRANQUIL THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
4397-15678-0032 ON THE PORTIONS MOST EASILY CLEARED SOME THREE HUNDRED ACRES OF HOP VINES HAVE BEEN PLANTED AND ARE NOW IN FULL BEARING YIELDING IT IS SAID AT THE RATE OF ABOUT A TON OF HOPS TO THE ACRE THEY ARE A BEAUTIFUL CROP THESE VINES OF THE NORTH
4397-15678-0033 PILLARS OF VERDURE IN REGULAR ROWS SEVEN FEET APART AND EIGHT OR TEN FEET IN HEIGHT THE LONG VIGOROUS SHOOTS SWEEPING ROUND IN FINE WILD FREEDOM AND THE LIGHT LEAFY CONES HANGING IN LOOSE HANDSOME CLUSTERS PERHAPS ENOUGH OF HOPS
4397-15678-0034 MIGHT BE RAISED IN WASHINGTON FOR THE WANTS OF ALL THE WORLD BUT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PICKERS TO HANDLE THE CROP MOST OF THE PICKING IS DONE BY INDIANS AND TO THIS FINE CLEAN PROFITABLE WORK THEY COME IN GREAT NUMBERS IN THEIR CANOES OLD AND YOUNG
4397-15678-0035 STILL MORE STRIKING ARE THEIR QUEER CAMPS ON THE EDGES OF THE FIELDS OR OVER ON THE RIVER BANK WITH THE FIRELIGHT SHINING ON THEIR WILD JOLLY FACES BUT WOE TO THE RANCH SHOULD FIRE WATER GET THERE BUT THE CHIEF ATTRACTIONS HERE ARE NOT FOUND IN THE HOPS
4397-15678-0036 BUT IN TROUT FISHING AND BEAR HUNTING AND IN THE TWO FINE FALLS ON THE RIVER FORMERLY THE TRIP FROM SEATTLE WAS A HARD ONE OVER CORDUROY ROADS NOW IT IS REACHED IN A FEW HOURS BY RAIL ALONG THE SHORES OF LAKE WASHINGTON AND LAKE SQUAK
4397-15678-0037 AND FINE VIEWS OF THE FALL MAY BE HAD ON THAT SIDE BOTH FROM ABOVE AND BELOW IT IS SITUATED ON THE MAIN RIVER WHERE IT PLUNGES OVER A SHEER PRECIPICE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET HIGH IN LEAVING THE LEVEL MEADOWS OF THE ANCIENT LAKE BASIN
4397-15678-0038 THE POOL IS OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH AS IS SHOWN BY THE RADIATING WELL BEATEN FOAM AND MIST WHICH IS OF A BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR AT TIMES OF EXQUISITE FINENESS OF TONE AND BY THE HEAVY WAVES THAT LASH THE ROCKS IN FRONT OF IT
4397-15678-0039 SET IN A ROMANTIC DELL THATCHED WITH DRIPPING MOSSES AND FERNS AND EMBOWERED IN DENSE EVERGREENS AND BLOOMING BUSHES
4397-15678-0040 THE ROAD LEADS THROUGH MAJESTIC WOODS WITH FERNS TEN FEET HIGH BENEATH SOME OF THE THICKETS AND ACROSS A GRAVELLY PLAIN DEFORESTED BY FIRE MANY YEARS AGO ORANGE LILIES ARE PLENTIFUL
4397-15678-0041 AND HANDSOME SHINING MATS OF THE KINNIKINIC SPRINKLED WITH BRIGHT SCARLET BERRIES FROM A PLACE CALLED HUNT'S AT THE END OF THE WAGON ROAD A TRAIL LEADS THROUGH LUSH DRIPPING WOODS NEVER DRY
4397-15678-0042 WHERE NEVER A DUST PARTICLE FLOATED AND WHERE ALL THE FLOWERS FRESH WITH MIST AND SPRAY ARE WETTER THAN WATER LILIES THE POOL AT THE FOOT OF THE FALL IS A PLACE SURPASSINGLY LOVELY TO LOOK AT WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC RUSH AND SONG OF THE FALLS
4397-15678-0043 THE MAJESTIC TREES OVERHEAD LEANING OVER THE BRINK LIKE LISTENERS EAGER TO CATCH EVERY WORD OF THE WHITE REFRESHING WATERS
4406-16882-0000 BELONGING TO OUR GARRISON BUT NONE OF THEM WOULD STIR THOUGH ANOTHER TIME IF ANY INDIAN HAD COME TO THE DOOR THEY WERE READY TO FLY UPON HIM AND TEAR HIM DOWN THE LORD HEREBY WOULD MAKE US THE MORE ACKNOWLEDGE HIS HAND AND TO SEE THAT OUR HELP IS ALWAYS IN HIM
4406-16882-0001 BUT OUT WE MUST GO THE FIRE INCREASING AND COMING ALONG BEHIND US ROARING AND THE INDIANS GAPING BEFORE US WITH THEIR GUNS SPEARS AND HATCHETS TO DEVOUR US
4406-16882-0002 IN OR NEAR THE THROAT FELL DOWN DEAD WHEREAT THE INDIANS SCORNFULLY SHOUTED AND HALLOWED AND WERE PRESENTLY UPON HIM STRIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES THE BULLETS FLYING THICK ONE WENT THROUGH MY SIDE AND THE SAME AS WOULD SEEM
4406-16882-0003 THROUGH THE BOWELS AND HAND OF MY DEAR CHILD IN MY ARMS ONE OF MY ELDER SISTERS CHILDREN NAMED WILLIAM HAD THEN HIS LEG BROKEN WHICH THE INDIANS PERCEIVING THEY KNOCKED HIM ON HIS HEAD
4406-16882-0004 STANDING AMAZED WITH THE BLOOD RUNNING DOWN TO OUR HEELS MY ELDEST SISTER BEING YET IN THE HOUSE AND SEEING THOSE WOEFUL SIGHTS THE INFIDELS HAULING MOTHERS ONE WAY AND CHILDREN ANOTHER AND SOME WALLOWING IN THEIR BLOOD
4406-16882-0005 AND HER ELDER SON TELLING HER THAT HER SON WILLIAM WAS DEAD AND MYSELF WAS WOUNDED SHE SAID AND LORD LET ME DIE WITH THEM WHICH WAS NO SOONER SAID BUT SHE WAS STRUCK WITH A BULLET AND FELL DOWN DEAD OVER THE THRESHOLD
4406-16882-0006 I HOPE SHE IS REAPING THE FRUIT OF HER GOOD LABORS BEING FAITHFUL TO THE SERVICE OF GOD IN HER PLACE IN HER YOUNGER YEARS SHE LAY UNDER MUCH TROUBLE UPON SPIRITUAL ACCOUNTS TILL IT PLEASED GOD TO MAKE THAT PRECIOUS SCRIPTURE TAKE HOLD OF HER HEART AND HE SAID UNTO ME
4406-16882-0007 OH THE DOLEFUL SIGHT THAT NOW WAS TO BEHOLD AT THIS HOUSE COME BEHOLD THE WORKS OF THE LORD
4406-16882-0008 AND RELATIONS LIE BLEEDING OUT THEIR HEART BLOOD UPON THE GROUND THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS CHOPPED INTO THE HEAD WITH A HATCHET AND STRIPPED NAKED
4406-16882-0009 AS IF THEY WOULD HAVE TORN OUR VERY HEARTS OUT YET THE LORD BY HIS ALMIGHTY POWER PRESERVED A NUMBER OF US FROM DEATH FOR THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR OF US TAKEN ALIVE AND CARRIED CAPTIVE I HAD OFTEN BEFORE THIS SAID THAT IF THE INDIANS SHOULD COME
4406-16882-0010 I SHOULD CHOOSE RATHER TO BE KILLED BY THEM THAN TAKEN ALIVE BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE TRIAL MY MIND CHANGED THEIR GLITTERING WEAPONS SO DAUNTED MY SPIRIT THAT I CHOSE RATHER TO GO ALONG WITH THOSE AS I MAY SAY RAVENOUS BEASTS
4406-16882-0011 THAN THAT MOMENT TO END MY DAYS AND THAT I MAY THE BETTER DECLARE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME DURING THAT GRIEVOUS CAPTIVITY I SHALL PARTICULARLY SPEAK OF THE SEVERAL REMOVES WE HAD UP AND DOWN THE WILDERNESS THE FIRST REMOVE NOW AWAY WE MUST GO WITH THOSE BARBAROUS CREATURES
4406-16882-0012 WITH OUR BODIES WOUNDED AND BLEEDING AND OUR HEARTS NO LESS THAN OUR BODIES ABOUT A MILE WE WENT THAT NIGHT UP UPON A HILL WITHIN SIGHT OF THE TOWN WHERE THEY INTENDED TO LODGE THERE WAS HARD BY A VACANT HOUSE DESERTED BY THE ENGLISH BEFORE FOR FEAR OF THE INDIANS
4406-16882-0013 I ASKED THEM WHETHER I MIGHT NOT LODGE IN THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED WHAT WILL YOU LOVE ENGLISH MEN STILL THIS WAS THE DOLEFULEST NIGHT THAT EVER MY EYES SAW OH THE ROARING AND SINGING AND DANCING AND YELLING OF THOSE BLACK CREATURES IN THE NIGHT
4406-16882-0014 SOME ROASTING SOME LYING AND BURNING AND SOME BOILING TO FEED OUR MERCILESS ENEMIES WHO WERE JOYFUL ENOUGH THOUGH WE WERE DISCONSOLATE
4406-16882-0015 AND THE DISMALNESS OF THE PRESENT NIGHT MY THOUGHTS RAN UPON MY LOSSES AND SAD BEREAVED CONDITION ALL WAS GONE MY HUSBAND GONE AT LEAST SEPARATED FROM ME HE BEING IN THE BAY AND TO ADD TO MY GRIEF THE INDIANS TOLD ME THEY WOULD KILL HIM AS HE CAME HOMEWARD
4406-16882-0016 MY CHILDREN GONE MY RELATIONS AND FRIENDS GONE OUR HOUSE AND HOME AND ALL OUR COMFORTS WITHIN DOOR AND WITHOUT ALL WAS GONE EXCEPT MY LIFE AND I KNEW NOT BUT THE NEXT MOMENT THAT MIGHT GO TOO THERE REMAINED NOTHING TO ME BUT ONE POOR WOUNDED BABE
4406-16882-0017 AND IT SEEMED AT PRESENT WORSE THAN DEATH THAT IT WAS IN SUCH A PITIFUL CONDITION BESPEAKING COMPASSION AND I HAD NO REFRESHING FOR IT NOR SUITABLE THINGS TO REVIVE IT LITTLE DO MANY THINK WHAT IS THE SAVAGENESS AND BRUTISHNESS OF THIS BARBAROUS ENEMY
4406-16882-0018 BY ONE EYED JOHN AND MARLBOROUGH'S PRAYING INDIANS WHICH CAPTAIN MOSELY BROUGHT TO BOSTON AS THE INDIANS TOLD ME THE SECOND REMOVE BUT NOW THE NEXT MORNING I MUST TURN MY BACK UPON THE TOWN AND TRAVEL WITH THEM INTO THE VAST AND DESOLATE WILDERNESS
4406-16882-0019 I KNEW NOT WHITHER IT IS NOT MY TONGUE OR PEN CAN EXPRESS THE SORROWS OF MY HEART AND BITTERNESS OF MY SPIRIT THAT I HAD AT THIS DEPARTURE BUT GOD WAS WITH ME IN A WONDERFUL MANNER CARRYING ME ALONG AND BEARING UP MY SPIRIT
4406-16882-0020 THAT IT DID NOT QUITE FAIL ONE OF THE INDIANS CARRIED MY POOR WOUNDED BABE UPON A HORSE IT WENT MOANING ALL ALONG I SHALL DIE I SHALL DIE I WENT ON FOOT AFTER IT WITH SORROW THAT CANNOT BE EXPRESSED AT LENGTH I TOOK IT OFF THE HORSE
4406-16882-0021 AND CARRIED IT IN MY ARMS TILL MY STRENGTH FAILED AND I FELL DOWN WITH IT THEN THEY SET ME UPON A HORSE WITH MY WOUNDED CHILD IN MY LAP AND THERE BEING NO FURNITURE UPON THE HORSE'S BACK AS WE WERE GOING DOWN A STEEP HILL WE BOTH FELL OVER THE HORSE'S HEAD
4406-16882-0022 AT WHICH THEY LIKE INHUMANE CREATURES LAUGHED AND REJOICED TO SEE IT THOUGH I THOUGHT WE SHOULD THERE HAVE ENDED OUR DAYS AS OVERCOME WITH SO MANY DIFFICULTIES BUT THE LORD RENEWED MY STRENGTH STILL AND CARRIED ME ALONG THAT I MIGHT SEE MORE OF HIS POWER
4406-16882-0023 BY A LITTLE FIRE AND A FEW BOUGHS BEHIND ME WITH MY SICK CHILD IN MY LAP
4406-16882-0024 MY OWN WOUND ALSO GROWING SO STIFF THAT I COULD SCARCE SIT DOWN OR RISE UP YET SO IT MUST BE THAT I MUST SIT ALL THIS COLD WINTER NIGHT UPON THE COLD SNOWY GROUND WITH MY SICK CHILD IN MY ARMS
4406-16882-0025 AND WE WERE BOTH ALIVE TO SEE THE LIGHT OF THE NEXT MORNING THE THIRD REMOVE
4406-16882-0026 ONE OF THE INDIANS GOT UP UPON A HORSE AND THEY SET ME UP BEHIND HIM WITH MY POOR SICK BABE IN MY LAP A VERY WEARISOME AND TEDIOUS DAY I HAD OF IT WHAT WITH MY OWN WOUND AND MY CHILD'S BEING SO EXCEEDING SICK AND IN A LAMENTABLE CONDITION WITH HER WOUND
4406-16882-0027 THIS DAY IN THE AFTERNOON ABOUT AN HOUR BY SUN
4406-16882-0028 MY WOUNDS STINK AND ARE CORRUPT I AM TROUBLED I AM BOWED DOWN GREATLY I GO MOURNING ALL THE DAY LONG I SAT MUCH ALONE WITH A POOR WOUNDED CHILD IN MY LAP WHICH MOANED NIGHT AND DAY HAVING NOTHING TO REVIVE THE BODY OR CHEER THE SPIRITS OF HER BUT INSTEAD OF THAT
4406-16882-0029 IN THIS MISERABLE CONDITION WITHOUT ANY REFRESHING OF ONE NATURE OR OTHER EXCEPT A LITTLE COLD WATER I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE HOW AT ANOTHER TIME I COULD NOT BEAR TO BE IN THE ROOM WHERE ANY DEAD PERSON WAS
4406-16882-0030 BY MY MASTER IN THIS WRITING MUST BE UNDERSTOOD QUINNAPIN WHO WAS A SAGAMORE AND MARRIED KING PHILIP'S WIFE'S SISTER NOT THAT HE FIRST TOOK ME BUT I WAS SOLD TO HIM BY ANOTHER NARRAGANSETT INDIAN WHO TOOK ME WHEN FIRST I CAME OUT OF THE GARRISON
4406-16882-0031 THERE WAS NO RESISTING BUT GO I MUST AND LEAVE IT WHEN I HAD BEEN AT MY MASTER'S WIGWAM
4406-16882-0032 WHEN I CAME I ASKED THEM WHAT THEY HAD DONE WITH IT THEN THEY TOLD ME IT WAS UPON THE HILL
4406-16882-0033 AND THERE THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD BURIED IT
4406-16882-0034 GOD HAVING TAKEN AWAY THIS DEAR CHILD I WENT TO SEE MY DAUGHTER MARY WHO WAS AT THIS SAME INDIAN TOWN AT A WIGWAM NOT VERY FAR OFF
4406-16882-0035 SHE WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD AND TAKEN FROM THE DOOR AT FIRST BY A PRAYING INDIANA AND AFTERWARD SOLD FOR A GUN
4406-16882-0036 AND YE WILL TAKE BENJAMIN ALSO ALL THESE THINGS ARE AGAINST ME
4406-16882-0037 AND AS I WAS GOING ALONG MY HEART WAS EVEN OVERWHELMED WITH THE THOUGHTS OF MY CONDITION AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE CHILDREN AND A NATION WHICH I KNEW NOT RULED OVER THEM WHEREUPON I EARNESTLY ENTREATED THE LORD THAT HE WOULD CONSIDER MY LOW ESTATE AND SHOW ME A TOKEN FOR GOOD AND IF IT WERE HIS BLESSED WILL
4406-16882-0038 I HAD NOT SEEN HIM BEFORE SINCE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TOWN AND I KNEW NOT WHERE HE WAS TILL I WAS INFORMED BY HIMSELF THAT HE WAS AMONGST A SMALLER PARCEL OF INDIANS WHOSE PLACE WAS ABOUT SIX MILES OFF WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES HE ASKED ME WHETHER HIS SISTER SARAH WAS DEAD
4406-16882-0039 AND TOLD ME HE HAD SEEN HIS SISTER MARY AND PRAYED ME THAT I WOULD NOT BE TROUBLED IN REFERENCE TO HIMSELF THE OCCASION OF HIS COMING TO SEE ME AT THIS TIME WAS THIS THERE WAS AS I SAID ABOUT SIX MILES FROM US A SMALL PLANTATION OF INDIANS WHERE IT SEEMS HE HAD BEEN DURING HIS CAPTIVITY
4406-16882-0040 ALL THE COMPANY FOR THOSE THAT BELONGED TO THE OTHER SMALL COMPANY CAME THROUGH THE TOWN THAT NOW WE WERE AT BUT BEFORE THEY CAME TO US OH THE OUTRAGEOUS ROARING AND HOOPING THAT THERE WAS THEY BEGAN THEIR DIN ABOUT A MILE BEFORE THEY CAME TO US
4406-16882-0041 BY THEIR NOISE AND HOOPING THEY SIGNIFIED HOW MANY THEY HAD DESTROYED WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME TWENTY THREE
4406-16882-0042 AND EVERY TIME THAT THE OTHER WENT OVER THEIR NUMBER THESE AT HOME GAVE A SHOUT THAT THE VERY EARTH RUNG AGAIN AND THUS THEY CONTINUED TILL THOSE THAT HAD BEEN UPON THE EXPEDITION WERE COME UP TO THE SAGAMORE'S WIGWAM AND THEN
4406-16882-0043 I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE OF THE WONDERFUL MERCY OF GOD TO ME IN THOSE AFFLICTIONS IN SENDING ME A BIBLE ONE OF THE INDIANS THAT CAME FROM MEDFIELD FIGHT HAD BROUGHT SOME PLUNDER CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME IF I WOULD HAVE A BIBLE HE HAD GOT ONE IN HIS BASKET
4406-16882-0044 AND TURN ALL THOSE CURSES UPON OUR ENEMIES I DO NOT DESIRE TO LIVE TO FORGET THIS SCRIPTURE AND WHAT COMFORT IT WAS TO ME NOW
4406-16882-0045 SOME ONE WAY AND SOME ANOTHER THERE WERE NOW BESIDES MYSELF NINE ENGLISH CAPTIVES IN THIS PLACE ALL OF THEM CHILDREN EXCEPT ONE WOMAN
4406-16882-0046 THEY BEING TO GO ONE WAY AND I ANOTHER I ASKED THEM WHETHER THEY WERE EARNEST WITH GOD FOR DELIVERANCE THEY TOLD ME THEY DID AS THEY WERE ABLE AND IT WAS SOME COMFORT TO ME THAT THE LORD STIRRED UP CHILDREN TO LOOK TO HIM
