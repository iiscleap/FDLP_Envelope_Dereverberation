625-132118-0045 SOME MORNING THIS MAY BE LONG LONG YEARS TO COME BUT NOW THERE WAILS ON THAT DARK SHORE WITHIN THE VEIL THE SAME DEEP VOICE THOU SHALT FOREGO
625-132118-0046 AND ALL HAVE I FOREGONE AT THAT COMMAND AND WITH SMALL COMPLAINT ALL SAVE THAT FAIR YOUNG FORM THAT LIES SO COLDLY WED WITH DEATH
625-132118-0047 IN THE NEST I HAD BUILDED IF ONE MUST HAVE GONE WHY NOT I WHY MAY I NOT REST ME FROM THIS RESTLESSNESS AND SLEEP FROM THIS WIDE WAKING
625-132118-0048 WAS NOT THE WORLD'S ALEMBIC TIME IN HIS YOUNG HANDS AND IS NOT MY TIME WANING ARE THERE SO MANY WORKERS IN THE VINEYARD THAT THE FAIR PROMISE OF THIS LITTLE BODY
625-132118-0049 COULD LIGHTLY BE TOSSED AWAY THE WRETCHED OF MY RACE THAT LINE THE ALLEYS OF THE NATION SIT FATHERLESS AND UNMOTHERED
625-132118-0050 SLEEP THEN CHILD SLEEP TILL I SLEEP AND WAKEN TO A BABY VOICE AND THE CEASELESS PATTER OF LITTLE FEET
6367-65536-0000 THE MAN HALTED ON THE CREST OF THE HILL AND LOOKED SOMBRELY DOWN INTO THE LONG VALLEY BELOW IT WAS EVENING AND ALTHOUGH THE HILLS AROUND HIM WERE STILL IN THE LIGHT THE VALLEY WAS ALREADY FILLED WITH KINDLY PLACID SHADOWS
6367-65536-0001 IT HAD BEEN BY THESE FIRS HE HAD HALTED TWENTY YEARS AGO TURNING FOR ONE LAST GLANCE AT THE VALLEY BELOW THE HOME VALLEY WHICH HE HAD NEVER SEEN SINCE BUT THEN
6367-65536-0002 THE FIRS HAD BEEN LITTLE MORE THAN VIGOROUS YOUNG SAPLINGS THEY WERE TALL GNARLED TREES NOW WITH LICHENED TRUNKS AND THEIR LOWER BOUGHS WERE DEAD BUT HIGH UP THEIR TOPS WERE GREEN AND CAUGHT THE SAFFRON LIGHT OF THE WEST
6367-65536-0003 HE REMEMBERED THAT WHEN A BOY HE HAD THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE EVENING SUNSHINE FALLING ATHWART THE DARK GREEN FIR BOUGHS ON THE HILLS AS HE LISTENED TO THE SWISH AND MURMUR OF THE WIND
6367-65536-0004 THE EARTH OLD TUNE WITH THE POWER TO CARRY THE SOUL BACK TO THE DAWN OF TIME THE YEARS FELL AWAY FROM HIM AND HE FORGOT MUCH REMEMBERING MORE
6367-65536-0005 HE HAD CALLED THAT LONGING BY OTHER NAMES BUT HE KNEW IT NOW FOR WHAT IT WAS WHEN HEARING HE WAS SATISFIED HE WAS A TALL MAN WITH IRON GREY HAIR AND THE FACE OF A CONQUEROR STRONG
6367-65536-0006 PITILESS UNSWERVING EAGLE EYES QUICK TO DISCERN AND UNFALTERING TO PURSUE JAW SQUARE AND INTREPID MOUTH FORMED TO KEEP SECRETS AND CAJOLE MEN TO HIS WILL
6367-65536-0007 A FACE THAT HID MUCH AND REVEALED LITTLE IT TOLD OF POWER AND INTELLECT BUT THE SOUL OF THE MAN WAS A HIDDEN THING
6367-65536-0008 NOT IN THE ARENA WHERE HE HAD FOUGHT AND TRIUMPHED GIVING FIERCE BLOW FOR BLOW WAS IT TO BE SHOWN BUT HERE LOOKING DOWN ON THE HOMELAND WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE HILLS ABOUT HIM IT ROSE DOMINANTLY AND CLAIMED ITS OWN
6367-65536-0009 THE OLD BOND HELD YONDER BELOW HIM WAS HOME THE OLD HOUSE THAT HAD SHELTERED HIM THE GRAVES OF HIS KIN THE WIDE FIELDS WHERE HIS BOYHOOD DREAMS HAD BEEN DREAMED
6367-65536-0010 THE PITTING OF STRENGTH AND CRAFT AGAINST STRENGTH AND CRAFT THE TIRELESS STRUGGLE THE EXULTATION OF VICTORY THEN SUDDENLY THEY HAD FAILED THEIR WORSHIPPER THEY CEASED TO SATISFY
6367-65536-0011 THE SACRIFICES HE HAD HEAPED ON THEIR ALTARS AVAILED HIM NOTHING IN THIS NEW NEED AND HUNGER OF HIS BEING HIS GODS MOCKED HIM AND HE WEARIED OF THEIR SERVICE WERE THERE NOT BETTER THINGS THAN THESE
6367-65536-0012 THINGS HE HAD ONCE KNOWN AND LOVED AND FORGOTTEN WHERE WERE THE IDEALS OF HIS YOUTH THE LOFTY ASPIRATIONS THAT HAD UPBORNE HIM THEN WHERE WAS THE EAGERNESS AND ZEST OF NEW DAWNS
6367-65536-0013 THE EARNESTNESS OF WELL FILLED PURPOSEFUL HOURS OF LABOUR THE SATISFACTION OF A GOOD DAY WORTHILY LIVED AT EVENTIDE THE UNBROKEN REST OF LONG STARRY NIGHTS WHERE MIGHT HE FIND THEM AGAIN
6367-65536-0014 WERE THEY YET TO BE HAD FOR THE SEEKING IN THE OLD VALLEY WITH THE THOUGHT CAME A GREAT YEARNING FOR HOME HE HAD HAD MANY HABITATIONS BUT HE REALIZED NOW THAT HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF ANY OF THESE PLACES AS HOME
6367-65536-0015 THAT NAME HAD ALL UNCONSCIOUSLY BEEN KEPT SACRED TO THE LONG GREEN SEAWARD LOOKING GLEN WHERE HE HAD BEEN BORN SO HE HAD COME BACK TO IT DRAWN BY A LONGING NOT TO BE RESISTED
6367-65536-0016 BUT AT THE LAST HE FELT AFRAID THERE HAD BEEN MANY CHANGES OF THAT HE FELT SURE WOULD IT STILL BE HOME AND IF NOT WOULD NOT THE LOSS BE MOST IRREPARABLE AND BITTER
6367-65536-0017 WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO GO AWAY HAVING LOOKED AT IT FROM THE HILL AND HAVING HEARD THE SAGA OF THE FIRS KEEPING HIS MEMORY OF IT UNBLURRED THAN RISK THE PROBABLE DISILLUSION OF A RETURN TO THE PLACES THAT HAD FORGOTTEN HIM
6367-65536-0018 AND FRIENDS WHOM THE VARYING YEARS MUST CERTAINLY HAVE CHANGED AS HE HAD CHANGED HIMSELF NO HE WOULD NOT GO DOWN IT HAD BEEN A FOOLISH WHIM TO COME AT ALL
6367-65536-0019 FOOLISH BECAUSE THE OBJECT OF HIS QUEST WAS NOT TO BE FOUND THERE OR ELSEWHERE HE COULD NOT ENTER AGAIN INTO THE HERITAGE OF BOYHOOD AND THE HEART OF YOUTH HE COULD NOT FIND THERE THE OLD DREAMS AND HOPES THAT HAD MADE LIFE SWEET
6367-65536-0020 HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE COULD NOT BRING BACK TO THE OLD VALLEY WHAT HE HAD TAKEN FROM IT HE HAD LOST THAT INTANGIBLE ALL REAL WEALTH OF FAITH AND IDEALISM AND ZEST
6367-65536-0021 AND HE REALIZED AT LAST HOW MUCH POORER HE WAS THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT THAT HOME VALLEY HIS WAS A NAME THAT STOOD FOR MILLIONS BUT HE WAS BEGGARED OF HOPE AND PURPOSE NO HE WOULD NOT GO DOWN
6367-65536-0022 THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT THERE UNCHANGED AND UNCHANGING TO WELCOME HIM HE WOULD BE A STRANGER THERE EVEN AMONG HIS KIN HE WOULD STAY AWHILE ON THE HILL UNTIL THE NIGHT CAME DOWN OVER IT
6367-65536-0023 AND THEN HE WOULD GO BACK TO HIS OWN PLACE DOWN BELOW HIM ON THE CREST OF A LITTLE UPLAND HE SAW HIS OLD HOME A WEATHER GREY HOUSE ALMOST HIDDEN AMONG WHITE BIRCH AND APPLE TREES
6367-65536-0024 WITH A THICK FIR GROVE TO THE NORTH OF IT HE HAD BEEN BORN IN THAT OLD HOUSE HIS EARLIEST MEMORY WAS OF STANDING ON ITS THRESHOLD AND LOOKING AFAR UP TO THE LONG GREEN HILLS WHAT IS OVER THE HILLS HE HAD ASKED OF HIS MOTHER
6367-65536-0025 WITH A SMILE SHE HAD MADE ANSWER MANY THINGS LADDIE WONDERFUL THINGS BEAUTIFUL THINGS HEART BREAKING THINGS SOME DAY I SHALL GO OVER THE HILLS AND FIND THEM ALL MOTHER
6367-65536-0026 HE HAD SAID STOUTLY SHE HAD LAUGHED AND SIGHED AND CAUGHT HIM TO HER HEART HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF HIS FATHER WHO HAD DIED SOON AFTER HIS SON'S BIRTH BUT HOW WELL HE REMEMBERED HIS MOTHER
6367-65536-0027 HIS LITTLE BROWN EYED GIRLISH FACED MOTHER HE HAD LIVED ON THE HOMESTEAD UNTIL HE WAS TWENTY HE HAD TILLED THE BROAD FIELDS AND GONE IN AND OUT AMONG THE PEOPLE AND THEIR LIFE HAD BEEN HIS LIFE BUT HIS HEART WAS NOT IN HIS WORK
6367-65536-0028 HE WANTED TO GO BEYOND THE HILLS AND SEEK WHAT HE KNEW MUST BE THERE THE VALLEY WAS TOO NARROW TOO PLACID HE LONGED FOR CONFLICT AND ACCOMPLISHMENT
6367-65536-0029 HE SOLD THE FARM TO HIS COUSIN STEPHEN MARSHALL HE SUPPOSED IT STILL BELONGED TO HIM STEPHEN HAD BEEN A GOOD SORT OF A FELLOW A BIT SLOW AND PLODDING PERHAPS BOVINELY CONTENT TO DWELL WITHIN THE HILLS
6367-65536-0030 NEVER HEARKENING OR RESPONDING TO THE LURE OF THE BEYOND YET IT MIGHT BE HE HAD CHOSEN THE BETTER PART TO DWELL THUS ON THE LAND OF HIS FATHERS WITH A WIFE WON IN YOUTH AND CHILDREN TO GROW UP AROUND HIM
6367-65536-0031 THE CHILDLESS WIFELESS MAN LOOKING DOWN FROM THE HILL WONDERED IF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO WITH HIM HAD HE BEEN CONTENT TO STAY IN THE VALLEY PERHAPS SO THERE HAD BEEN JOYCE
6367-65536-0032 NOT SO FAR FROM HIS OWN JUST ACROSS A GREEN MEADOW BY WAY OF A FOOTPATH AND STILE AND THROUGH THE FIRS BEYOND IT HOW OFTEN HE HAD TRAVERSED THAT PATH IN THE OLD DAYS KNOWING THAT JOYCE WOULD BE WAITING AT THE END OF IT AMONG THE FIRS
6367-65536-0033 JOYCE THE PLAYMATE OF CHILDHOOD THE SWEET CONFIDANTE AND COMPANION OF YOUTH THEY HAD NEVER BEEN AVOWED LOVERS BUT HE HAD LOVED HER THEN AS A BOY LOVES ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER SAID A WORD OF LOVE TO HER
6367-65536-0034 JOYCE ALONE KNEW OF HIS LONGINGS AND HIS AMBITIONS AND HIS DREAMS HE HAD TOLD THEM ALL TO HER FREELY SURE OF THE UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY NO OTHER SOUL IN THE VALLEY COULD GIVE HIM
6367-65536-0035 HOW TRUE AND STRONG AND WOMANLY AND GENTLE SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN WHEN HE LEFT HOME HE HAD MEANT TO GO BACK TO HER SOME DAY THEY HAD PARTED WITHOUT PLEDGE OR KISS YET HE KNEW SHE LOVED HIM AND THAT HE LOVED HER
6367-65536-0036 AT FIRST THEY CORRESPONDED THEN THE LETTERS BEGAN TO GROW FEWER IT WAS HIS FAULT HE HAD GRADUALLY FORGOTTEN THE NEW FIERCE BURNING INTERESTS THAT CAME INTO HIS LIFE CROWDED THE OLD ONES OUT
6367-65536-0037 BOYHOOD'S LOVE WAS SCORCHED UP IN THAT HOT FLAME OF AMBITION AND CONTEST HE HAD NOT HEARD FROM OR OF JOYCE FOR MANY YEARS NOW AGAIN HE REMEMBERED AS HE LOOKED DOWN ON THE HOMELAND FIELDS
6367-65536-0038 THE OLD PLACES HAD CHANGED LITTLE WHATEVER HE MIGHT FEAR OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THEM THERE WAS THE SCHOOL HE HAD ATTENDED A SMALL LOW EAVED WHITE WASHED BUILDING SET BACK FROM THE MAIN ROAD AMONG GREEN SPRUCES
6367-65536-0039 BEYOND IT AMID TALL ELMS WAS THE OLD CHURCH WITH ITS SQUARE TOWER HUNG WITH IVY HE FELT GLAD TO SEE IT HE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE A NEW CHURCH
6367-65536-0040 OFFENSIVELY SPICK AND SPAN AND MODERN FOR THIS CHURCH HAD BEEN OLD WHEN HE WAS A BOY HE RECALLED THE MANY TIMES HE HAD WALKED TO IT ON THE PEACEFUL SUNDAY AFTERNOONS SOMETIMES WITH HIS MOTHER SOMETIMES WITH JOYCE
6367-65536-0041 THE SUN SET FAR OUT TO SEA AND SUCKED DOWN WITH IT ALL THE LIGHT OUT OF THE WINNOWED DOME OF SKY THE STARS CAME OUT SINGLY AND CRYSTAL CLEAR OVER THE FAR PURPLE CURVES OF THE HILLS
6367-65536-0042 SUDDENLY GLANCING OVER HIS SHOULDER HE SAW THROUGH AN ARCH OF BLACK FIR BOUGHS A YOUNG MOON SWUNG LOW IN A LAKE OF PALELY TINTED SAFFRON SKY HE SMILED A LITTLE
6367-65536-0043 REMEMBERING THAT IN BOYHOOD IT HAD BEEN HELD A GOOD OMEN TO SEE THE NEW MOON OVER THE RIGHT SHOULDER DOWN IN THE VALLEY THE LIGHTS BEGAN TO TWINKLE OUT HERE AND THERE LIKE EARTH STARS
6367-65536-0044 HE WOULD WAIT UNTIL HE SAW THE KITCHEN LIGHT FROM THE WINDOW OF HIS OLD HOME THEN HE WOULD GO
6367-65536-0045 BUT NO LIGHT GLIMMERED OUT THROUGH HIS NATIVE TREES WHY WAS IT LACKING THAT LIGHT HE HAD SO OFTEN HAILED AT DARK COMING HOME FROM BOYISH RAMBLES ON THE HILLS
6367-65536-0046 HE FELT ANXIOUS AND DISSATISFIED AS IF HE COULD NOT GO AWAY UNTIL HE HAD SEEN IT WHEN IT WAS QUITE DARK HE DESCENDED THE HILL RESOLUTELY HE MUST KNOW WHY THE HOMELIGHT HAD FAILED HIM
6367-65536-0047 EVEN IN THE DIMNESS OF THE SUMMER NIGHT TO SEE THAT THE OLD HOUSE WAS DESERTED AND FALLING TO DECAY THE KITCHEN DOOR SWUNG OPEN ON RUSTY HINGES THE WINDOWS WERE BROKEN AND LIFELESS
6367-65536-0048 CUTHBERT MARSHALL SAT DOWN ON THE OLD RED SANDSTONE STEP OF THE DOOR AND BOWED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS THIS WAS WHAT HE HAD COME BACK TO THIS GHOST AND WRECK OF HIS PAST OH
6367-65536-0049 STEPHEN CAME TO IT A STOUT GRIZZLED FARMER WITH A CHUBBY BOY ON HIS SHOULDER HE WAS NOT MUCH CHANGED CUTHBERT EASILY RECOGNIZED HIM
6367-65536-0050 CUTHBERT WAS OBLIGED TO TELL WHO HE WAS HE WAS MADE INSTANTLY AND WARMLY WELCOME STEPHEN WAS UNFEIGNEDLY GLAD TO SEE HIM AND STEPHEN'S COMELY WIFE WHOM HE REMEMBERED AS A SLIM FRESH CHEEKED VALLEY GIRL
6367-65536-0051 HE AND STEPHEN TALKED LATE THAT NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING HE YIELDED TO THEIR ENTREATIES TO STAY ANOTHER DAY WITH THEM HE SPENT IT WANDERING ABOUT THE FARM AND THE OLD HAUNTS OF WOOD AND STREAM YET HE COULD NOT FIND HIMSELF
6367-65536-0052 THIS VALLEY HAD HIS PAST IN ITS KEEPING BUT IT COULD NOT GIVE IT BACK TO HIM HE HAD LOST THE MASTER WORD THAT MIGHT HAVE COMPELLED IT HE ASKED STEPHEN FULLY ABOUT ALL HIS OLD FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS WITH ONE EXCEPTION
6367-65536-0053 BY THE OLD FOOTPATH WHICH WAS STILL KEPT OPEN HE WALKED SLOWLY AND DREAMILY WITH HIS EYES ON THE FAR HILLS SCARFED IN THE SPLENDOUR OF SUNSET SO HE HAD WALKED IN THE OLD DAYS BUT HE HAD NO DREAMS NOW OF WHAT LAY BEYOND THE HILLS
6367-65536-0054 AND JOYCE WOULD NOT BE WAITING AMONG THE FIRS THE STILE HE REMEMBERED WAS GONE REPLACED BY A LITTLE RUSTIC GATE AS HE PASSED THROUGH IT HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND THERE BEFORE HIM
6367-65536-0055 AND THE SOUL OF HER LOOKED OUT THROUGH THEM TRUE TO ITSELF THE STAUNCH BRAVE SWEET SOUL OF THE MAIDEN RIPENED TO WOMANHOOD JOYCE HE SAID STUPIDLY UNBELIEVINGLY
6367-65536-0056 BUT HE TOOK BOTH AND HELD HER SO LOOKING HUNGRILY DOWN AT HER AS A MAN LOOKS AT SOMETHING HE KNOWS MUST BE HIS SALVATION IF SALVATION EXISTS FOR HIM IS IT POSSIBLE YOU ARE HERE STILL JOYCE
6367-65536-0057 HE SAID SLOWLY AND YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED AT ALL SHE COLOURED SLIGHTLY AND PULLED AWAY HER HANDS LAUGHING OH INDEED I HAVE I HAVE GROWN OLD
6367-65536-0058 THE TWILIGHT IS SO KIND IT HIDES THAT BUT IT IS TRUE COME INTO THE HOUSE CUTHBERT FATHER AND MOTHER WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU AFTER A LITTLE HE SAID IMPLORINGLY LET US STAY HERE AWHILE FIRST JOYCE
6367-65536-0059 LAST NIGHT I STOOD ON THOSE HILLS YONDER AND LOOKED DOWN BUT I MEANT TO GO AWAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE NO ONE LEFT TO WELCOME ME IF I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE HERE YOU HAVE LIVED HERE IN THE OLD VALLEY ALL THESE YEARS
6367-65536-0060 ALL THESE YEARS SHE SAID GENTLY I SUPPOSE YOU THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY MEAGRE LIFE NO I AM MUCH WISER NOW THAN I WAS ONCE JOYCE I HAVE LEARNED WISDOM BEYOND THE HILLS ONE LEARNS THERE
6367-65536-0061 IN TIME BUT SOMETIMES THE LESSON IS LEARNED TOO LATE SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE LEARNED JOYCE THE GIST OF THE LESSON IS THAT I LEFT HAPPINESS BEHIND ME IN THE OLD VALLEY WHEN I WENT AWAY FROM IT HAPPINESS AND PEACE AND THE JOY OF LIVING
6367-65536-0062 I DID NOT MISS THESE THINGS FOR A LONG WHILE I DID NOT EVEN KNOW I HAD LOST THEM BUT I HAVE DISCOVERED MY LOSS YET YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL MAN SHE SAID WONDERINGLY
6367-65536-0063 AS THE WORLD CALLS SUCCESS HE ANSWERED BITTERLY I HAVE PLACE AND WEALTH AND POWER BUT THAT IS NOT SUCCESS JOYCE I AM TIRED OF THESE THINGS THEY ARE THE TOYS OF GROWN UP CHILDREN
6367-65536-0064 THEY DO NOT SATISFY THE MAN'S SOUL I HAVE COME BACK TO THE OLD VALLEY SEEKING FOR WHAT MIGHT SATISFY BUT I HAVE LITTLE HOPE OF FINDING IT UNLESS UNLESS HE WAS SILENT
6367-65536-0065 REMEMBERING THAT HE HAD FORFEITED ALL RIGHT TO HER HELP IN THE QUEST YET HE REALIZED CLEARLY THAT ONLY SHE COULD HELP HIM ONLY SHE COULD GUIDE HIM BACK TO THE PATH HE HAD MISSED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE HELD IN HER KEEPING
6367-65536-0066 ALL THE GOOD OF HIS LIFE ALL THE BEAUTY OF HIS PAST ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF HIS FUTURE HERS WAS THE MASTER WORD BUT HOW SHOULD HE DARE ASK HER TO UTTER IT
6367-65536-0067 THEY WALKED AMONG THE FIRS UNTIL THE STARS CAME OUT AND THEY TALKED OF MANY THINGS SHE HAD KEPT HER FRESHNESS OF SOUL AND HER IDEALS UNTARNISHED IN THE PEACE OF THE OLD VALLEY SHE HAD LIVED A LIFE NARROW OUTWARDLY
6367-65536-0068 WONDROUSLY DEEP AND WIDE IN THOUGHT AND ASPIRATION HER NATIVE HILLS BOUNDED THE VISION OF HER EYES BUT THE OUTLOOK OF THE SOUL WAS FAR AND UNHINDERED
6367-65536-0069 IN THE QUIET PLACES AND THE GREEN WAYS SHE HAD FOUND WHAT HE HAD FAILED TO FIND THE SECRET OF HAPPINESS AND CONTENT HE KNEW THAT IF THIS WOMAN HAD WALKED HAND IN HAND WITH HIM THROUGH THE YEARS
6367-65536-0070 LIFE EVEN IN THE GLARE AND TUMULT OF THAT WORLD BEYOND THE HILLS WOULD NEVER HAVE LOST ITS MEANING FOR HIM OH FOOL AND BLIND THAT HE HAD BEEN WHILE HE HAD SOUGHT AND TOILED AFAR
6367-65536-0071 THE BEST THAT GOD HAD MEANT FOR HIM HAD BEEN HERE IN THE HOME OF YOUTH WHEN DARKNESS CAME DOWN THROUGH THE FIRS HE TOLD HER ALL THIS HALTINGLY BLUNDERINGLY YEARNINGLY JOYCE
6367-65536-0072 IS IT TOO LATE CAN YOU FORGIVE MY MISTAKE MY LONG BLINDNESS CAN YOU CARE FOR ME AGAIN A LITTLE SHE TURNED HER FACE UPWARD TO THE SKY BETWEEN THE SWAYING FIR TOPS
6367-65536-0073 AND HE SAW THE REFLECTION OF A STAR IN HER EYES I HAVE NEVER CEASED TO CARE SHE SAID IN A LOW TONE I NEVER REALLY WANTED TO CEASE IT WOULD HAVE LEFT LIFE TOO EMPTY IF MY LOVE MEANS SO MUCH TO YOU
6367-65536-0074 IT IS YOURS CUTHBERT IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN YOURS HE DREW HER CLOSE INTO HIS ARMS AND AS HE FELT HER HEART BEATING AGAINST HIS HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD FOUND THE WAY BACK TO SIMPLE HAPPINESS AND TRUE WISDOM
6367-74004-0000 RUGGLES AND I WERE DOWN ON THE OLD FELLOW IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY AND SINCE IN A STORY OF THIS KIND WE MUST TELL THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS OR ELSE WHERE IS THE USE OF WRITING A STORY AT ALL
6367-74004-0001 HE IS PRINCIPAL OF THE FRAMPTON ACADEMY THE OLD FELLOW NOT RUGGLES AND HIS NAME IS GEORGE OSBORNE WE HAVE TO CALL HIM MISTER OSBORNE TO HIS FACE BUT HE IS THE OLD FELLOW EVERYWHERE ELSE
6367-74004-0002 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT THEY LIKE HIM TOO I HEARD EMMA WHITE SAY ONCE THAT HE WAS SO HANDSOME I NEARLY WHOOPED RUGGLES WAS MAD BECAUSE HE'S GONE ON EM
6367-74004-0003 HE IS SPLENDID BIG SIX FOOTER WITH MAGNIFICENT MUSCLES RED CHEEKS AND CURLY YELLOW HAIR I CAN'T SEE HOW HE CAN BE CONTENTED TO SIT DOWN AND TEACH MUSHY ENGLISH LITERATURE AND POETRY AND THAT SORT OF THING
6367-74004-0004 THERE WAS A RUMOUR RUNNING AT LARGE IN THE ACADEMY THAT THE OLD FELLOW WROTE POETRY BUT HE RAN THE MATHEMATICS AND DIDN'T MAKE SUCH A FOOZLE OF IT AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE EITHER
6367-74004-0005 AT LEAST WE SAID SO BUT IF PROVIDENCE HADN'T SENT SYLVIA GRANT WALKING DOWN THE STREET PAST OUR BOARDING HOUSE THAT AFTERNOON WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE COOLED OFF BEFORE WE THOUGHT OF ANY WORKING PLAN OF REVENGE SYLVIA GRANT DID GO DOWN THE STREET HOWEVER
6367-74004-0006 RUGGLES HANGING HALFWAY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS USUAL SAW HER AND CALLED ME TO GO AND LOOK OF COURSE I WENT SYLVIA GRANT WAS ALWAYS WORTH LOOKING AT THERE WAS NO GIRL IN FRAMPTON WHO COULD HOLD A CANDLE TO HER WHEN IT CAME TO BEAUTY
6367-74004-0007 MY PRIVATE OPINION IS THAT SYLVIA HADN'T ANY OR SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE PREFERRED BUT THERE I'M GETTING ON TOO FAST AGAIN RUGGLES SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS STORY HE CAN CONCENTRATE BETTER SYLVIA WAS THE LATIN PROFESSOR'S DAUGHTER
6367-74004-0008 SHE WASN'T A CAD GIRL OF COURSE SHE WAS OVER TWENTY AND HAD GRADUATED FROM IT TWO YEARS AGO BUT SHE WAS IN ALL THE SOCIAL THINGS THAT WENT ON IN THE ACADEMY AND ALL THE UNMARRIED PROFESSORS EXCEPT THE OLD FELLOW WERE IN LOVE WITH HER
6367-74004-0009 MICKY HAD IT THE WORST AND WE HAD ALL MADE UP OUR MINDS THAT SYLVIA WOULD MARRY MICKY HE WAS SO HANDSOME WE DIDN'T SEE HOW SHE COULD HELP IT I TELL YOU THEY MADE A DANDY LOOKING COUPLE WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER WELL AS I SAID BEFORE I TODDLED TO THE WINDOW TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE FAIR SYLVIA
6367-74004-0010 THEY WERE BROWNISH KIND OF AND SHE'D A SPANKING HAT ON WITH FEATHERS AND THINGS IN IT HER HAIR WAS SHINING UNDER IT ALL PURPLY BLACK AND SHE LOOKED SWEET ENOUGH TO EAT
6367-74004-0011 AND HER BIG BLACKISH BLUE EYES SPARKLED BUT SHE HADN'T BEEN LAUGHING BEFORE OR SPARKLING EITHER
6367-74004-0012 I RATHER SUSPECTED IT FOR AT THE SENIOR PROM THREE NIGHTS BEFORE SHE HAD HARDLY LOOKED AT MICKY BUT HAD SAT IN A CORNER AND TALKED TO THE OLD FELLOW HE DIDN'T DO MUCH TALKING HE WAS TOO SHY AND HE LOOKED MIGHTY UNCOMFORTABLE
6367-74004-0013 BUT WHEN I SAW MICKY SCOWLING AT THE CORNER I KNEW SHE WAS DOING IT TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS GIRLS WON'T STICK AT ANYTHING WHEN THEY WANT TO PROVOKE A CHAP I KNOW IT TO MY COST FOR JENNIE PRICE
6367-74004-0014 HE CAUGHT SYLVIA DOING THE SAME THING SO HE WHEELED AND CAME ON LOOKING MIGHTY FOOLISH AS HE PASSED BENEATH OUR WINDOW RUGGLES CHUCKLED FIENDISHLY I'VE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING POLLY HE SAID MY NAME IS PAUL
6367-74004-0015 LET'S WRITE A LETTER TO SYLVIA GRANT A LOVE LETTER AND SIGN THE OLD FELLOW'S NAME TO IT SHE'LL GIVE HIM A FEARFUL SNUBBING AND WE'LL BE REVENGED BUT WHO'LL WRITE IT I SAID DOUBTFULLY I CAN'T
6367-74004-0016 YOU'LL HAVE TO RUGGLES YOU'VE HAD MORE PRACTICE RUGGLES TURNED RED I KNOW HE WRITES TO EM WHITE IN VACATIONS I'LL DO MY BEST HE SAID QUITE MEEKLY THAT IS I'LL COMPOSE IT BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO COPY IT
6367-74004-0017 YOU CAN IMITATE THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING SO WELL BUT LOOK HERE I SAID AN UNCOMFORTABLE IDEA STRIKING ME WHAT ABOUT SYLVIA WON'T SHE FEEL KIND OF FLATTISH WHEN SHE FINDS OUT HE DIDN'T WRITE IT FOR OF COURSE HE'LL TELL HER
6367-74004-0018 SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE OLD FELLOW A BIT I KNOW FROM THE WAY SHE ACTS WITH HIM SHE'S ALWAYS SO COOL AND STIFF WHEN HE'S ABOUT NOT A BIT LIKE SHE IS WITH THE OTHER PROFESSORS WELL RUGGLES WROTE THE LETTER AT FIRST HE TRIED TO PASS IT OFF ON ME AS HIS OWN COMPOSITION
