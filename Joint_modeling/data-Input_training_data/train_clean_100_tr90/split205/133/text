5163-39921-0019 ASKED ESTHER THEY DISAPPEAR SAID MISTER BAXTER WITH A SIGNIFICANT NOD WHEN THE PLUMS ARE ANYTHING LIKE RIPE MISSUS CHARLEY DISCOVERS SOME DAY THAT THERE ISN'T ONE LEFT ON THE TREE
5163-39921-0020 SHE HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET A SCRAP OF PROOF AS TO WHO TOOK THEM OR SHE'D MAKE IT HOT FOR THEM BUT NOBODY IN MAITLAND HAS ANY DOUBT IN HIS OWN MIND THAT ISAAC CROPPER KNOWS WHERE THOSE PLUMS GO
5163-39921-0021 I DON'T THINK MISTER CROPPER WOULD STEAL PROTESTED ESTHER WELL HE DOESN'T CONSIDER IT STEALING YOU KNOW HE CLAIMS THE LAND AND SAYS THE PLUMS ARE HIS
5163-39921-0022 I DON'T DOUBT THAT HE IS QUITE CLEAR IN HIS OWN MIND THAT THEY ARE AND HE DOES HATE MISSUS CHARLEY I'D GIVE CONSIDERABLE TO SEE THE OLD SINNER FAIRLY CAUGHT BUT HE IS TOO DEEP
5163-39921-0023 I THINK MISTER BAXTER IS TOO HARD ON MISTER CROPPER SAID ESTHER TO HERSELF LATER ON HE HAS PROBABLY SOME PRIVATE PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM BUT A MONTH LATER SHE HAD CHANGED HER OPINION
5163-39921-0024 DURING THAT TIME THE CROPPER BOYS HAD COME TO SCHOOL AT FIRST ESTHER HAD BEEN INCLINED TO LIKE THEM THEY WERE HANDSOME LADS WITH THE SAME SMOOTH WAY THAT CHARACTERIZED THEIR FATHER AND SEEMED BRIGHT AND INTELLIGENT
5163-39921-0025 FOR A FEW DAYS ALL WENT WELL AND ESTHER FELT DECIDEDLY RELIEVED BUT BEFORE LONG A SUBTLE SPIRIT OF INSUBORDINATION BEGAN TO MAKE ITSELF FELT IN THE SCHOOL ESTHER FOUND HERSELF POWERLESS TO COPE WITH IT
5163-39921-0026 THE CROPPERS NEVER OPENLY DEFIED HER BUT THEY DID PRECISELY AS THEY PLEASED THE OTHER PUPILS THOUGHT THEMSELVES AT LIBERTY TO FOLLOW THIS EXAMPLE AND IN A MONTH'S TIME POOR ESTHER HAD COMPLETELY LOST CONTROL OF HER LITTLE KINGDOM
5163-39921-0027 SOME COMPLAINTS WERE HEARD AMONG THE RATEPAYERS AND EVEN MISTER BAXTER LOOKED DUBIOUS SHE KNEW THAT UNLESS SHE COULD REGAIN HER AUTHORITY SHE WOULD BE REQUESTED TO HAND IN HER RESIGNATION
5163-39921-0028 BUT SHE WAS BAFFLED BY THE ELUSIVE SYSTEM OF DEFIANCE WHICH THE CROPPER BOYS HAD ORGANIZED ONE DAY SHE RESOLVED TO GO TO MISTER CROPPER HIMSELF AND APPEAL TO HIS SENSE OF JUSTICE IF HE HAD ANY
5163-39921-0029 IT HAD BEEN AN ESPECIALLY HARD DAY IN SCHOOL WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ABSENT AT THE NOON HOUR ALL THE DESKS IN THE SCHOOLROOM HAD BEEN PILED IN A PYRAMID ON THE FLOOR BOOKS AND SLATES INTERCHANGED AND VARIOUS OTHER PRANKS PLAYED
5163-39921-0030 WHEN QUESTIONED EVERY PUPIL DENIED HAVING DONE OR HELPED TO DO IT ALFRED AND BOB CROPPER LOOKED HER SQUARELY IN THE EYES AND DECLARED THEIR INNOCENCE IN THEIR USUAL GENTLEMANLY FASHION YET ESTHER FELT SURE THAT THEY WERE THE GUILTY ONES
5163-39921-0031 SHE ALSO KNEW WHAT EXAGGERATED ACCOUNTS OF THE AFFAIR WOULD BE TAKEN HOME TO MAITLAND TEA TABLES AND SHE FELT LIKE SITTING DOWN TO CRY BUT SHE DID NOT INSTEAD SHE SET HER MOUTH FIRMLY HELPED THE CHILDREN RESTORE THE ROOM TO ORDER
5163-39921-0032 AND AFTER SCHOOL WENT UP TO ISAAC CROPPER'S HOUSE THAT GENTLEMAN HIMSELF CAME IN FROM THE HARVEST FIELD LOOKING AS COURTLY AS USUAL EVEN IN HIS ROUGH WORKING CLOTHES HE SHOOK HANDS HEARTILY TOLD HER HE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER
5163-39921-0033 AND BEGAN TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER ESTHER WAS NOT TO BE TURNED FROM HER OBJECT THUS ALTHOUGH SHE FELT HER COURAGE EBBING AWAY FROM HER AS IT ALWAYS DID IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CROPPER IMPERVIOUSNESS
5163-39921-0034 I HAVE COME UP TO SEE YOU ABOUT ALFRED AND ROBERT MISTER CROPPER SHE SAID THEY ARE NOT BEHAVING WELL IN SCHOOL INDEED MISTER CROPPER'S VOICE EXPRESSED BLAND SURPRISE THAT IS STRANGE
5163-39921-0035 AS A RULE I DO NOT THINK ALFRED AND ROBERT HAVE BEEN TROUBLESOME TO THEIR TEACHERS WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN DOING NOW THEY REFUSE TO OBEY MY ORDERS SAID ESTHER FAINTLY
5163-39921-0036 MY BOYS ARE HIGH SPIRITED FELLOWS AND NEED A STRONG FIRM HAND TO RESTRAIN THEM I HAVE ALWAYS SAID I CONSIDERED IT ADVISABLE TO EMPLOY A MALE TEACHER IN MAITLAND SCHOOL WE SHOULD HAVE BETTER ORDER
5163-39921-0037 NOT THAT I DISAPPROVE OF YOU PERSONALLY FAR FROM IT I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE YOU SUCCEED BUT I HAVE HEARD MANY COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE ORDER IN SCHOOL AT PRESENT I HAD NO TROUBLE UNTIL YOUR BOYS CAME
5163-39921-0038 RETORTED ESTHER LOSING HER TEMPER A LITTLE AND I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WERE WILLING TO CO OPERATE WITH ME THAT I COULD GOVERN THEM WELL YOU SEE SAID MISTER CROPPER EASILY
5163-39921-0039 WHEN I SEND MY BOYS TO SCHOOL I NATURALLY EXPECT THAT THE TEACHER WILL BE CAPABLE OF DOING THE WORK SHE HAS BEEN HIRED TO DO THEN YOU REFUSE TO HELP ME SAID ESTHER IN A TREMBLING VOICE
5163-39921-0040 WHY MY DEAR YOUNG LADY WHAT CAN I DO BOYS SOON KNOW WHEN THEY CAN DISOBEY A TEACHER WITH IMPUNITY NO DOUBT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE A SCHOOL EASIER TO CONTROL AND WILL DO GOOD WORK
5163-39921-0041 BUT HERE AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID WE NEED A FIRM HAND AT THE HELM BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING YET MISS MAXWELL YOU NEED SOME REFRESHMENT AFTER YOUR LONG WALK MISSUS CROPPER WILL BRING YOU IN SOMETHING NO THANK YOU SAID POOR ESTHER
5163-39921-0042 SHE FELT THAT SHE MUST GET AWAY AT ONCE OR SHE WOULD BURST INTO HEARTSICK TEARS UNDER THOSE STEELY BLAND BLUE EYES WHEN SHE GOT HOME SHE SHUT HERSELF UP IN HER ROOM AND CRIED THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HER TO DO BUT RESIGN SHE THOUGHT DISMALLY
5163-39921-0043 ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY ESTHER WENT FOR AN AFTERNOON WALK CARRYING HER KODAK WITH HER IT WAS A BRILLIANTLY FINE AUTUMN DAY AND WOODS AND FIELDS WERE BASKING IN A MELLOW HAZE ESTHER WENT ACROSS LOTS TO MISSUS CHARLEY CROPPER'S HOUSE INTENDING TO MAKE A CALL
5163-39921-0044 BUT THE HOUSE WAS LOCKED UP AND EVIDENTLY DESERTED SO SHE RAMBLED PAST IT TO THE BACK FIELDS PASSING THROUGH A GROVE OF MAPLES SHE CAME OUT AMONG LEAFY YOUNG SAPLINGS ON THE OTHER SIDE JUST BEYOND HER WITH ITS LADEN BOUGHS HANGING OVER THE LINE FENCE
5163-39921-0045 WAS THE FAMOUS PLUM TREE ESTHER LOOKED AT IT FOR A MOMENT THEN AN ODD SMILE GLEAMED OVER HER FACE AND SHE LIFTED HER KODAK MONDAY EVENING ESTHER CALLED ON MISTER CROPPER AGAIN
5163-39921-0046 AFTER THE PRELIMINARY REMARKS IN WHICH HE INDULGED SHE SAID WITH SEEMING IRRELEVANCE THAT SATURDAY HAD BEEN A FINE DAY THERE WAS AN EXCELLENT LIGHT FOR SNAPSHOTS SHE WENT ON COOLLY
5163-39921-0047 I HAVE BROUGHT YOU UP A PROOF I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IT SHE ROSE AND PLACED THE PROOF ON THE TABLE BEFORE MISTER CROPPER THE PLUM TREE CAME OUT CLEARLY
5163-39921-0048 BOB AND ALF CROPPER WERE UP AMONG THE BOUGHS PICKING THE PLUMS ON THE GROUND BENEATH THEM STOOD THEIR FATHER WITH A BASKET OF FRUIT IN HIS HAND MISTER CROPPER LOOKED AT THE PROOF AND FROM IT TO ESTHER
5163-39921-0049 HIS EYES HAD LOST THEIR UNCONCERNED GLITTER BUT HIS VOICE WAS DEFIANT THE PLUMS ARE MINE BY RIGHT HE SAID PERHAPS SAID ESTHER CALMLY BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO DO NOT THINK SO
5163-39921-0050 MISSUS CHARLEY FOR INSTANCE SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS PROOF I THINK DON'T SHOW IT TO HER CRIED MISTER CROPPER HASTILY I TELL YOU MISS MAXWELL THE PLUMS ARE MINE BUT I AM TIRED OF FIGHTING OVER THEM
5163-39921-0051 AND I HAD DECIDED BEFORE THIS THAT I'D LET HER HAVE THEM AFTER THIS IT'S ONLY A TRIFLE ANYHOW AND ABOUT THAT LITTLE MATTER WE WERE DISCUSSING THE OTHER NIGHT MISS MAXWELL I HAVE BEEN THINKING IT OVER AND
5163-39921-0052 I ADMIT I WAS SOMEWHAT UNREASONABLE I'LL TALK TO ALFRED AND ROBERT AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO VERY WELL SAID ESTHER QUIETLY THE MATTER OF THE PLUMS ISN'T MY BUSINESS
5163-39921-0053 AND I DON'T WISH TO BE INVOLVED IN YOUR FAMILY FEUDS ESPECIALLY AS YOU SAY THAT YOU MEAN TO ALLOW MISSUS CHARLEY TO ENJOY HER OWN IN FUTURE AS FOR THE SCHOOL WE WILL HOPE THAT MATTERS WILL IMPROVE
5163-39921-0054 YOU'LL LEAVE THE PROOF WITH ME WON'T YOU SAID MISTER CROPPER EAGERLY OH CERTAINLY SAID ESTHER SMILING I HAVE THE NEGATIVE STILL YOU KNOW FROM THAT TIME OUT THE CROPPER BOYS WERE MODELS OF GOOD BEHAVIOUR AND THE OTHER TURBULENT SPIRITS
5163-39921-0055 HAVING LOST THEIR LEADERS WERE SOON QUELLED COMPLAINT DIED AWAY AND AT THE END OF THE TERM ESTHER WAS RE ENGAGED YOU SEEM TO HAVE WON OLD CROPPER OVER TO YOUR SIDE ENTIRELY MISTER BAXTER TOLD HER THAT NIGHT
5163-39921-0056 I NEVER KNEW ISAAC CROPPER TO CHANGE HIS OPINIONS SO HANDSOMELY ESTHER SMILED
5192-19396-0000 THE FATES WHO CERTAINLY ALL FORE KNEW OF THESE AMOURS OF WIDOW WADMAN AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD FROM THE FIRST CREATION OF MATTER AND MOTION AND WITH MORE COURTESY THAN THEY USUALLY DO THINGS OF THIS KIND ESTABLISHED SUCH A CHAIN OF CAUSES AND EFFECTS HANGING SO FAST TO ONE ANOTHER
5192-19396-0001 THAT IT WAS SCARCE POSSIBLE FOR MY UNCLE TOBY TO HAVE DWELT IN ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE WORLD OR TO HAVE OCCUPIED ANY OTHER GARDEN IN CHRISTENDOM BUT THE VERY HOUSE AND GARDEN WHICH JOIN'D AND LAID PARALLEL TO MISSUS WADMAN'S THIS WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF A THICKSET
5192-19396-0002 ARBOUR IN MISSUS WADMAN'S GARDEN BUT PLANTED IN THE HEDGE ROW OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S PUT ALL THE OCCASIONS INTO HER HANDS WHICH LOVE MILITANCY WANTED SHE COULD OBSERVE MY UNCLE TOBY'S MOTIONS
5192-19396-0003 QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY INTERRUPTING HIM AS HE MENTIONED THE BLIND GUT IN A DISCOURSE WITH MY FATHER THE NIGHT MY MOTHER WAS BROUGHT TO BED OF ME I BESEECH YOU QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY TO TELL ME WHICH IS THE BLIND GUT FOR OLD AS I AM I VOW I DO NOT KNOW TO THIS DAY WHERE IT LIES
5192-19396-0004 THE BLIND GUT ANSWERED DOCTOR SLOP LIES BETWIXT THE ILION AND COLON IN A MAN SAID MY FATHER
5192-19396-0005 IN A WOMAN THAT'S MORE THAN I KNOW QUOTH MY FATHER
5192-19396-0006 NEITHER AT THIS END OR THAT BUT LIKE A PRODIGAL'S CANDLE TO LIGHT HIM IF POSSIBLE AT BOTH ENDS AT ONCE NOW THROUGH ALL THE LUMBER ROOMS OF MILITARY FURNITURE INCLUDING BOTH OF HORSE AND FOOT
5192-19396-0007 AND WITH BRIDGET TO HELP HER SHE COULD NOT HAVE FOUND ANY ONE BLIND OR MANTELET SO FIT FOR HER PURPOSE AS THAT WHICH THE EXPEDIENCY OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S AFFAIRS HAD FIX'D UP READY TO HER HANDS I BELIEVE I HAVE NOT TOLD YOU BUT I DON'T KNOW POSSIBLY I HAVE BE IT AS IT WILL
5192-19396-0008 TIS ONE OF THE NUMBER OF THOSE MANY THINGS WHICH A MAN HAD BETTER DO OVER AGAIN THAN DISPUTE ABOUT IT THAT WHATEVER TOWN OR FORTRESS THE CORPORAL WAS AT WORK UPON DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR CAMPAIGN MY UNCLE TOBY ALWAYS TOOK CARE ON THE INSIDE OF HIS SENTRY BOX
5192-19396-0009 WHICH WAS TOWARDS HIS LEFT HAND TO HAVE A PLAN OF THE PLACE FASTEN'D UP WITH TWO OR THREE PINS AT THE TOP BUT LOOSE AT THE BOTTOM
5192-19396-0010 SO THAT WHEN AN ATTACK WAS RESOLVED UPON MISSUS WADMAN HAD NOTHING MORE TO DO WHEN SHE HAD GOT ADVANCED TO THE DOOR OF THE SENTRY BOX BUT TO EXTEND HER RIGHT HAND
5192-19396-0011 TO TAKE HOLD OF THE MAP OR PLAN OR UPRIGHT OR WHATEVER IT WAS AND WITH OUT STRETCHED NECK MEETING IT HALF WAY TO ADVANCE IT TOWARDS HER ON WHICH MY UNCLE TOBY'S PASSIONS WERE SURE TO CATCH FIRE FOR HE WOULD INSTANTLY TAKE HOLD OF THE OTHER CORNER OF THE MAP IN HIS LEFT HAND
5192-19396-0012 AND WITH THE END OF HIS PIPE IN THE OTHER BEGIN AN EXPLANATION WHEN THE ATTACK WAS ADVANCED TO THIS POINT THE WORLD WILL NATURALLY ENTER INTO THE REASONS OF MISSUS WADMAN'S NEXT STROKE OF GENERALSHIP WHICH WAS TO TAKE MY UNCLE TOBY'S TOBACCO PIPE OUT OF HIS HAND AS SOON AS SHE POSSIBLY COULD WHICH
5192-19396-0013 UNDER ONE PRETENCE OR OTHER BUT GENERALLY THAT OF POINTING MORE DISTINCTLY AT SOME REDOUBT OR BREASTWORK IN THE MAP SHE WOULD EFFECT BEFORE MY UNCLE TOBY POOR SOUL HAD WELL MARCH'D ABOVE HALF A DOZEN TOISES WITH IT IT OBLIGED MY UNCLE TOBY TO MAKE USE OF HIS FOREFINGER
5192-19396-0014 THE DIFFERENCE IT MADE IN THE ATTACK WAS THIS THAT IN GOING UPON IT AS IN THE FIRST CASE WITH THE END OF HER FORE FINGER AGAINST THE END OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S TOBACCO PIPE SHE MIGHT HAVE TRAVELLED WITH IT ALONG THE LINES FROM DAN TO BEERSHEBA HAD MY UNCLE TOBY'S LINES REACH'D SO FAR
5192-19396-0015 WITHOUT ANY EFFECT FOR AS THERE WAS NO ARTERIAL OR VITAL HEAT IN THE END OF THE TOBACCO PIPE IT COULD EXCITE NO SENTIMENT IT COULD NEITHER GIVE FIRE BY PULSATION OR RECEIVE IT BY SYMPATHY
5192-19396-0016 WHEREAS IN FOLLOWING MY UNCLE TOBY'S FOREFINGER WITH HERS CLOSE THRO ALL THE LITTLE TURNS AND INDENTINGS OF HIS WORKS PRESSING SOMETIMES AGAINST THE SIDE OF IT THEN TREADING UPON ITS NAIL THEN TRIPPING IT UP THEN TOUCHING IT HERE THEN THERE AND SO ON
5192-19396-0017 IT SET SOMETHING AT LEAST IN MOTION THIS THO SLIGHT SKIRMISHING AND AT A DISTANCE FROM THE MAIN BODY YET DREW ON THE REST FOR HERE THE MAP USUALLY FALLING WITH THE BACK OF IT CLOSE TO THE SIDE OF THE SENTRY BOX MY UNCLE TOBY
5192-19396-0018 IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS SOUL WOULD LAY HIS HAND FLAT UPON IT IN ORDER TO GO ON WITH HIS EXPLANATION AND MISSUS WADMAN BY A MANOEUVRE AS QUICK AS THOUGHT WOULD AS CERTAINLY PLACE HER'S CLOSE BESIDE IT THIS AT ONCE OPENED A COMMUNICATION
5192-19396-0019 LARGE ENOUGH FOR ANY SENTIMENT TO PASS OR RE PASS WHICH A PERSON SKILL'D IN THE ELEMENTARY AND PRACTICAL PART OF LOVE MAKING HAS OCCASION FOR BY BRINGING UP HER FOREFINGER PARALLEL AS BEFORE TO MY UNCLE TOBY'S IT UNAVOIDABLY BROUGHT THE THUMB INTO ACTION
5192-19396-0020 AND THE FOREFINGER AND THUMB BEING ONCE ENGAGED AS NATURALLY BROUGHT IN THE WHOLE HAND THINE DEAR UNCLE TOBY
5192-19396-0021 MISSUS WADMAN HAD IT EVER TO TAKE UP OR WITH THE GENTLEST PUSHINGS PROTRUSIONS AND EQUIVOCAL COMPRESSIONS THAT A HAND TO BE REMOVED IS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING TO GET IT PRESS'D A HAIR BREADTH OF ONE SIDE OUT OF HER WAY
5192-19396-0022 WHILST THIS WAS DOING HOW COULD SHE FORGET TO MAKE HIM SENSIBLE
5192-19396-0023 WHICH SLIGHTLY PRESS'D AGAINST THE CALF OF HIS
5192-19396-0024 WAS IT A WONDER IF NOW AND THEN IT PUT HIS CENTRE INTO DISORDER THE DUCE TAKE IT SAID MY UNCLE TOBY
5192-19396-0025 YOU WILL READILY CONCEIVE TO BE OF DIFFERENT KINDS VARYING FROM EACH OTHER LIKE THE ATTACKS WHICH HISTORY IS FULL OF AND FROM THE SAME REASONS A GENERAL LOOKER ON WOULD SCARCE ALLOW THEM TO BE ATTACKS AT ALL OR IF HE DID WOULD CONFOUND THEM ALL TOGETHER BUT I WRITE NOT TO THEM
5192-19396-0026 IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO BE A LITTLE MORE EXACT IN MY DESCRIPTIONS OF THEM AS I COME UP TO THEM WHICH WILL NOT BE FOR SOME CHAPTERS HAVING NOTHING MORE TO ADD IN THIS BUT THAT IN A BUNDLE OF ORIGINAL PAPERS AND DRAWINGS WHICH MY FATHER TOOK CARE TO ROLL UP BY THEMSELVES
5192-19396-0027 THERE IS A PLAN OF BOUCHAIN IN PERFECT PRESERVATION AND SHALL BE KEPT SO WHILST I HAVE POWER TO PRESERVE ANY THING UPON THE LOWER CORNER OF WHICH ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THERE IS STILL REMAINING THE MARKS OF A SNUFFY FINGER AND THUMB
5192-19396-0028 WHICH THERE IS ALL THE REASON IN THE WORLD TO IMAGINE WERE MISSUS WADMAN'S FOR THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MARGIN WHICH I SUPPOSE TO HAVE BEEN MY UNCLE TOBY'S IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAN THIS SEEMS AN AUTHENTICATED RECORD OF ONE OF THESE ATTACKS
5192-19396-0029 BUT STILL VISIBLE ON THE OPPOSITE CORNER OF THE MAP WHICH ARE UNQUESTIONABLY THE VERY HOLES THROUGH WHICH IT HAS BEEN PRICKED UP IN THE SENTRY BOX BY ALL THAT IS PRIESTLY I VALUE THIS PRECIOUS RELICK WITH ITS STIGMATA AND PRICKS MORE THAN ALL THE RELICKS OF THE ROMISH CHURCH
5192-19396-0030 ALWAYS EXCEPTING WHEN I AM WRITING UPON THESE MATTERS THE PRICKS WHICH ENTERED THE FLESH OF SAINT RADAGUNDA IN THE DESERT WHICH IN YOUR ROAD FROM FESSE TO CLUNY THE NUNS OF THAT NAME WILL SHEW YOU FOR LOVE
5192-19396-0031 THE FORTIFICATIONS ARE QUITE DESTROYED
5192-19396-0032 I THINK SO TOO REPLIED MY UNCLE TOBY WITH A SIGH HALF SUPPRESS'D BUT STEP INTO THE PARLOUR TRIM FOR THE STIPULATION IT LIES UPON THE TABLE IT HAS LAIN THERE THESE SIX WEEKS REPLIED THE CORPORAL TILL THIS VERY MORNING THAT THE OLD WOMAN KINDLED THE FIRE WITH IT
5192-19397-0000 IT WAS A THOUSAND PITIES THOUGH I BELIEVE AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR
5192-19397-0001 A SOLDIER CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY INTERRUPTING THE CORPORAL IS NO MORE EXEMPT FROM SAYING A FOOLISH THING TRIM THAN A MAN OF LETTERS BUT NOT SO OFTEN AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR REPLIED THE CORPORAL MY UNCLE TOBY GAVE A NOD IT WAS A THOUSAND PITIES THEN SAID THE CORPORAL
5192-19397-0002 CASTING HIS EYE UPON DUNKIRK AND THE MOLE
5192-19397-0003 IN RETURNING OUT OF ASIA WHEN HE SAILED FROM AEGINA TOWARDS MEGARA
5192-19397-0004 WAS A THOUSAND PITIES AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR TO DESTROY THESE WORKS
5192-19397-0005 THOU ART RIGHT TRIM IN BOTH CASES SAID MY UNCLE TOBY THIS CONTINUED THE CORPORAL IS THE REASON THAT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THEIR DEMOLITION TO THE END I HAVE NEVER ONCE WHISTLED OR SUNG OR LAUGH'D OR CRY'D OR TALK'D OF PAST DONE DEEDS
5192-19397-0006 OR TOLD YOUR HONOUR ONE STORY GOOD OR BAD THOU HAST MANY EXCELLENCIES TRIM SAID MY UNCLE TOBY AND I HOLD IT NOT THE LEAST OF THEM AS THOU HAPPENEST TO BE A STORY TELLER THAT OF THE NUMBER THOU HAST TOLD ME EITHER TO AMUSE ME IN MY PAINFUL HOURS
5192-19397-0007 OR DIVERT ME IN MY GRAVE ONES THOU HAST SELDOM TOLD ME A BAD ONE BECAUSE AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR
5192-19397-0008 THEY ARE ALL TRUE FOR THEY ARE ABOUT MYSELF I DO NOT LIKE THE SUBJECT THE WORSE TRIM SAID MY UNCLE TOBY ON THAT SCORE BUT PRITHEE WHAT IS THIS STORY THOU HAST EXCITED MY CURIOSITY
5192-19397-0009 I'LL TELL IT YOUR HONOUR QUOTH THE CORPORAL DIRECTLY PROVIDED SAID MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING EARNESTLY TOWARDS DUNKIRK AND THE MOLE AGAIN PROVIDED IT IS NOT A MERRY ONE TO SUCH TRIM A MAN SHOULD EVER BRING ONE HALF OF THE ENTERTAINMENT ALONG WITH HIM
5192-19397-0010 AND THE DISPOSITION I AM IN AT PRESENT WOULD WRONG BOTH THEE TRIM AND THY STORY IT IS NOT A MERRY ONE BY ANY MEANS REPLIED THE CORPORAL NOR WOULD I HAVE IT ALTOGETHER A GRAVE ONE ADDED MY UNCLE TOBY IT IS NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER REPLIED THE CORPORAL
5192-19397-0011 BUT WILL SUIT YOUR HONOUR EXACTLY THEN I'LL THANK THEE FOR IT WITH ALL MY HEART CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY SO PRITHEE BEGIN IT TRIM THE CORPORAL MADE HIS REVERENCE AND THOUGH IT IS NOT SO EASY A MATTER AS THE WORLD IMAGINES TO PULL OFF A LANK MONTERO CAP
5192-19397-0012 WITH GRACE OR A WHIT LESS DIFFICULT IN MY CONCEPTIONS WHEN A MAN IS SITTING SQUAT UPON THE GROUND TO MAKE A BOW SO TEEMING WITH RESPECT AS THE CORPORAL WAS WONT
5192-19397-0013 WHICH WAS TOWARDS HIS MASTER TO SLIP BACKWARDS UPON THE GRASS A LITTLE BEYOND HIS BODY IN ORDER TO ALLOW IT THE GREATER SWEEP AND BY AN UNFORCED COMPRESSION AT THE SAME TIME OF HIS CAP WITH THE THUMB AND THE TWO FOREFINGERS OF HIS LEFT BY WHICH THE DIAMETER
5192-19397-0014 OF THE CAP BECAME REDUCED SO THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID RATHER TO BE INSENSIBLY SQUEEZ'D THAN PULL'D OFF WITH A FLATUS THE CORPORAL ACQUITTED HIMSELF OF BOTH IN A BETTER MANNER THAN THE POSTURE OF HIS AFFAIRS PROMISED AND HAVING HEMMED TWICE
5192-19397-0015 TO FIND IN WHAT KEY HIS STORY WOULD BEST GO AND BEST SUIT HIS MASTER'S HUMOUR HE EXCHANGED A SINGLE LOOK OF KINDNESS WITH HIM AND SET OFF THUS THE STORY OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA AND HIS SEVEN CASTLES THERE WAS A CERTAIN KING OF BO
5192-19397-0016 HE AS THE CORPORAL WAS ENTERING THE CONFINES OF BOHEMIA MY UNCLE TOBY OBLIGED HIM TO HALT FOR A SINGLE MOMENT HE HAD SET OUT BARE HEADED HAVING SINCE HE PULL'D OFF HIS MONTERO CAP IN THE LATTER END OF THE LAST CHAPTER LEFT IT LYING BESIDE HIM ON THE GROUND
5192-19397-0017 SO THAT BEFORE THE CORPORAL HAD WELL GOT THROUGH THE FIRST FIVE WORDS OF HIS STORY HAD MY UNCLE TOBY TWICE TOUCH'D HIS MONTERO CAP WITH THE END OF HIS CANE INTERROGATIVELY AS MUCH AS TO SAY WHY DON'T YOU PUT IT ON TRIM TRIM TOOK IT UP WITH THE MOST RESPECTFUL SLOWNESS
5192-19397-0018 AND CASTING A GLANCE OF HUMILIATION AS HE DID IT UPON THE EMBROIDERY OF THE FORE PART WHICH BEING DISMALLY TARNISH'D AND FRAY'D MOREOVER IN SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL LEAVES AND BOLDEST PARTS OF THE PATTERN HE LAY'D IT DOWN AGAIN BETWEEN HIS TWO FEET IN ORDER TO MORALIZE UPON THE SUBJECT
5192-19397-0019 THAT THOU ART ABOUT TO OBSERVE NOTHING IN THIS WORLD TRIM IS MADE TO LAST FOR EVER BUT WHEN TOKENS DEAR TOM OF THY LOVE AND REMEMBRANCE WEAR OUT SAID TRIM WHAT SHALL WE SAY THERE IS NO OCCASION TRIM QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY
5192-19397-0020 TO SAY ANY THING ELSE AND WAS A MAN TO PUZZLE HIS BRAINS TILL DOOM'S DAY I BELIEVE TRIM IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THE CORPORAL PERCEIVING MY UNCLE TOBY WAS IN THE RIGHT AND THAT IT WOULD BE IN VAIN FOR THE WIT OF MAN TO THINK OF EXTRACTING A PURER MORAL FROM HIS CAP
5192-19397-0021 WITHOUT FURTHER ATTEMPTING IT HE PUT IT ON AND PASSING HIS HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD TO RUB OUT A PENSIVE WRINKLE WHICH THE TEXT AND THE DOCTRINE BETWEEN THEM HAD ENGENDER'D HE RETURN'D WITH THE SAME LOOK AND TONE OF VOICE TO HIS STORY OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA AND HIS SEVEN CASTLES
5192-19397-0022 THE STORY OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA AND HIS SEVEN CASTLES CONTINUED THERE WAS A CERTAIN KING OF BOHEMIA BUT IN WHOSE REIGN EXCEPT HIS OWN I AM NOT ABLE TO INFORM YOUR HONOUR I DO NOT DESIRE IT OF THEE TRIM BY ANY MEANS CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY
5192-19397-0023 IT WAS A LITTLE BEFORE THE TIME AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR WHEN GIANTS WERE BEGINNING TO LEAVE OFF BREEDING BUT IN WHAT YEAR OF OUR LORD THAT WAS I WOULD NOT GIVE A HALFPENNY TO KNOW SAID MY UNCLE TOBY ONLY AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR IT MAKES A STORY LOOK THE BETTER IN THE FACE
5192-19397-0024 SO ORNAMENT IT AFTER THY OWN FASHION AND TAKE ANY DATE CONTINUED MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING PLEASANTLY UPON HIM TAKE ANY DATE IN THE WHOLE WORLD THOU CHUSEST AND PUT IT TO THOU ART HEARTILY WELCOME THE CORPORAL BOWED FOR OF EVERY CENTURY
5192-19397-0025 AND OF EVERY YEAR OF THAT CENTURY FROM THE FIRST CREATION OF THE WORLD DOWN TO NOAH'S FLOOD AND FROM NOAH'S FLOOD TO THE BIRTH OF ABRAHAM THROUGH ALL THE PILGRIMAGES OF THE PATRIARCHS TO THE DEPARTURE OF THE ISRAELITES OUT OF EGYPT AND THROUGHOUT ALL THE DYNASTIES OLYMPIADS
5192-19397-0026 URBECONDITAS AND OTHER MEMORABLE EPOCHAS OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONS OF THE WORLD DOWN TO THE COMING OF CHRIST AND FROM THENCE TO THE VERY MOMENT IN WHICH THE CORPORAL WAS TELLING HIS STORY HAD MY UNCLE TOBY SUBJECTED THIS VAST EMPIRE OF TIME
5192-19397-0027 AND ALL ITS ABYSSES AT HIS FEET BUT AS MODESTY SCARCE TOUCHES WITH A FINGER WHAT LIBERALITY OFFERS HER WITH BOTH HANDS OPEN THE CORPORAL CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH THE VERY WORST YEAR OF THE WHOLE BUNCH WHICH TO PREVENT YOUR HONOURS OF THE MAJORITY AND MINORITY
5192-19397-0028 FROM TEARING THE VERY FLESH OFF YOUR BONES IN CONTESTATION WHETHER THAT YEAR IS NOT ALWAYS THE LAST CAST YEAR OF THE LAST CAST ALMANACK' I TELL YOU PLAINLY IT WAS BUT FROM A DIFFERENT REASON THAN YOU WOT OF IT WAS THE YEAR NEXT HIM
