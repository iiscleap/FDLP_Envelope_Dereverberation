6209-34599-0018 SHE OCCUPIED BOTH HIS ARMS AND TO HIM WHO WALKS OVER ICE BOTH ARMS ARE A NATURAL AND NECESSARY BALANCING POWER HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO WITHOUT THIS BALANCE HE DID WITHOUT IT AND ADVANCED
6209-34599-0019 BENDING UNDER HIS BURDEN NOT KNOWING WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HIM THIS LITTLE INFANT WAS THE DROP CAUSING THE CUP OF DISTRESS TO OVERFLOW HE ADVANCED REELING AT EVERY STEP AS IF ON A SPRING BOARD
6209-34599-0020 AND ACCOMPLISHING WITHOUT SPECTATORS MIRACLES OF EQUILIBRIUM LET US REPEAT THAT HE WAS PERHAPS FOLLOWED ON THIS PATH OF PAIN BY EYES UNSLEEPING IN THE DISTANCES OF THE SHADOWS THE EYES OF THE MOTHER AND THE EYES OF GOD
6209-34599-0021 HE STAGGERED SLIPPED RECOVERED HIMSELF TOOK CARE OF THE INFANT AND GATHERING THE JACKET ABOUT HER HE COVERED UP HER HEAD STAGGERED AGAIN ADVANCED SLIPPED THEN DREW HIMSELF UP THE COWARDLY WIND DROVE AGAINST HIM
6209-34599-0022 APPARENTLY HE MADE MUCH MORE WAY THAN WAS NECESSARY HE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCE ON THE PLAINS WHERE BINCLEAVES FARM WAS AFTERWARDS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN WHAT ARE NOW CALLED SPRING GARDENS AND THE PARSONAGE HOUSE
6209-34599-0023 HOMESTEADS AND COTTAGES OCCUPY THE PLACE OF WASTE LANDS SOMETIMES LESS THAN A CENTURY SEPARATES A STEPPE FROM A CITY SUDDENLY A LULL HAVING OCCURRED IN THE ICY BLAST WHICH WAS BLINDING HIM
6209-34599-0024 HE PERCEIVED AT A SHORT DISTANCE IN FRONT OF HIM A CLUSTER OF GABLES AND OF CHIMNEYS SHOWN IN RELIEF BY THE SNOW THE REVERSE OF A SILHOUETTE A CITY PAINTED IN WHITE ON A BLACK HORIZON
6209-34599-0025 SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WE CALL NOWADAYS A NEGATIVE PROOF ROOFS DWELLINGS SHELTER HE HAD ARRIVED SOMEWHERE AT LAST HE FELT THE INEFFABLE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HOPE
6209-34599-0026 THE WATCH OF A SHIP WHICH HAS WANDERED FROM HER COURSE FEELS SOME SUCH EMOTION WHEN HE CRIES LAND HO HE HURRIED HIS STEPS AT LENGTH THEN HE WAS NEAR MANKIND
6209-34599-0027 THERE GLOWED WITHIN HIM THAT SUDDEN WARMTH SECURITY THAT OUT OF WHICH HE WAS EMERGING WAS OVER THENCEFORWARD THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE NIGHT NOR WINTER NOR TEMPEST
6209-34599-0028 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD LEFT ALL EVIL CHANCES BEHIND HIM
6209-34599-0029 HE ALMOST RAN HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON THE ROOFS THERE WAS LIFE THERE HE NEVER TOOK HIS EYES OFF THEM A DEAD MAN MIGHT GAZE THUS ON WHAT MIGHT APPEAR THROUGH THE HALF OPENED LID OF HIS SEPULCHRE
6209-34599-0030 THERE WERE THE CHIMNEYS OF WHICH HE HAD SEEN THE SMOKE NO SMOKE AROSE FROM THEM NOW HE WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED THE HOUSES HE CAME TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF A TOWN AN OPEN STREET
6209-34599-0031 AT THAT PERIOD BARS TO STREETS WERE FALLING INTO DISUSE THE STREET BEGAN BY TWO HOUSES IN THOSE TWO HOUSES NEITHER CANDLE NOR LAMP WAS TO BE SEEN NOR IN THE WHOLE STREET NOR IN THE WHOLE TOWN
6209-34599-0032 SO FAR AS EYE COULD REACH THE HOUSE TO THE RIGHT WAS A ROOF RATHER THAN A HOUSE NOTHING COULD BE MORE MEAN THE WALLS WERE OF MUD THE ROOF WAS OF STRAW AND THERE WAS MORE THATCH THAN WALL
6209-34599-0033 A LARGE NETTLE SPRINGING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL REACHED THE ROOF THE HOVEL HAD BUT ONE DOOR WHICH WAS LIKE THAT OF A DOG KENNEL AND A WINDOW WHICH WAS BUT A HOLE ALL WAS SHUT UP AT THE SIDE
6209-34599-0034 AN INHABITED PIG STY TOLD THAT THE HOUSE WAS ALSO INHABITED THE HOUSE ON THE LEFT WAS LARGE HIGH BUILT ENTIRELY OF STONE WITH A SLATED ROOF
6209-34599-0035 OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE PAUPER THE BOY DID NOT HESITATE HE APPROACHED THE GREAT MANSION THE DOUBLE FOLDING DOOR OF MASSIVE OAK STUDDED WITH LARGE NAILS WAS OF THE KIND THAT LEADS ONE TO EXPECT
6209-34599-0036 NO ANSWER HE STRUCK AGAIN AND TWO KNOCKS NO MOVEMENT WAS HEARD IN THE HOUSE HE KNOCKED A THIRD TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND HE SAW THAT THEY WERE ALL ASLEEP AND DID NOT CARE TO GET UP
6209-34599-0037 BUT LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD NO VOICE WAS HEARD NO STEP MOVED NO CANDLE WAS LIGHTED HE SAW THAT THERE AS WELL THEY DID NOT CARE TO AWAKE
6209-34599-0038 THE HOUSE OF STONE AND THE THATCHED HOVEL WERE EQUALLY DEAF TO THE WRETCHED THE BOY DECIDED ON PUSHING ON FURTHER
6209-34600-0000 ANOTHER FORM OF DESERT IT WAS WEYMOUTH WHICH HE HAD JUST ENTERED WEYMOUTH THEN WAS NOT THE RESPECTABLE AND FINE WEYMOUTH OF TO DAY ANCIENT WEYMOUTH DID NOT PRESENT LIKE THE PRESENT ONE
6209-34600-0001 FOR THE SAME REASON THEY HAD NOT YET DESIGNED ON THE SLOPE OF THE GREEN HILL TOWARDS THE EAST FASHIONED FLAT ON THE SOIL BY CUTTING AWAY THE TURF AND LEAVING THE BARE CHALK TO THE VIEW THE WHITE HORSE AN ACRE LONG
6209-34600-0002 GEORGE THE THIRD HAVING LOST IN HIS OLD AGE THE INTELLECT HE HAD NEVER POSSESSED IN HIS YOUTH WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CALAMITIES OF HIS REIGN HE WAS AN INNOCENT WHY NOT ERECT STATUES TO HIM
6209-34600-0003 EVEN GOOD WOMEN IN THEIR HOUSES A PELL MELL OF SHEDS THROWN FROM HER DEVIL'S BAG WOULD GIVE AN IDEA OF THAT IRREGULAR WEYMOUTH THE GOOD WOMEN IN THE SHEDS INCLUDED THE MUSIC HALL REMAINS AS A SPECIMEN OF THOSE BUILDINGS
6209-34600-0004 A CONFUSION OF WOODEN DENS CARVED AND EATEN BY WORMS WHICH CARVE IN ANOTHER FASHION SHAPELESS OVERHANGING BUILDINGS SOME WITH PILLARS LEANING ONE AGAINST THE OTHER FOR SUPPORT AGAINST THE SEA WIND
6209-34600-0005 AND LEAVING BETWEEN THEM AWKWARD SPACES OF NARROW AND WINDING CHANNELS LANES AND PASSAGES OFTEN FLOODED
6209-34600-0006 THE DESERTED CHILD CARRYING THE FOUNDLING PASSED THROUGH THE FIRST STREET THEN THE SECOND THEN THE THIRD
6209-34600-0007 BUT ALL WERE CLOSED AND DARK AT INTERVALS HE KNOCKED AT THE DOORS NO ONE ANSWERED NOTHING MAKES THE HEART SO LIKE A STONE AS BEING WARM BETWEEN SHEETS THE NOISE AND THE SHAKING HAD AT LENGTH AWAKENED THE INFANT
6209-34600-0008 HE KNEW THIS BECAUSE HE FELT HER SUCK HIS CHEEK SHE DID NOT CRY BELIEVING HIM HER MOTHER HE WAS ABOUT TO TURN AND WANDER LONG PERHAPS IN THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE SCRAMBRIDGE LANES
6209-34600-0009 THEN MORE CULTIVATED PLOTS THAN DWELLINGS MORE THORN HEDGES THAN HOUSES BUT FORTUNATELY HE STRUCK INTO A PASSAGE WHICH EXISTS TO THIS DAY NEAR TRINITY SCHOOLS THIS PASSAGE LED HIM TO A WATER BRINK
6209-34600-0010 WITH MELCOMBE REGIS AND UNDER THE ARCHES OF WHICH THE BACKWATER JOINS THE HARBOUR WEYMOUTH A HAMLET WAS THEN THE SUBURB OF MELCOMBE REGIS A CITY AND PORT NOW MELCOMBE REGIS IS A PARISH OF WEYMOUTH
6209-34600-0011 THE VILLAGE HAS ABSORBED THE CITY IT WAS THE BRIDGE WHICH DID THE WORK BRIDGES ARE STRANGE VEHICLES OF SUCTION WHICH INHALE THE POPULATION AND SOMETIMES SWELL ONE RIVER BANK AT THE EXPENSE OF ITS OPPOSITE NEIGHBOUR
6209-34600-0012 THE BOY WENT TO THE BRIDGE WHICH AT THAT PERIOD WAS A COVERED TIMBER STRUCTURE HE CROSSED IT
6209-34600-0013 THE BRIDGE OPENED ON A RATHER FINE STREET CALLED SAINT THOMAS'S STREET HE ENTERED IT HERE AND THERE WERE HIGH CARVED GABLES AND SHOP FRONTS HE SET TO KNOCKING AT THE DOORS AGAIN
6209-34600-0014 HE HAD NO STRENGTH LEFT TO CALL OR SHOUT AT MELCOMBE REGIS AS AT WEYMOUTH NO ONE WAS STIRRING THE DOORS WERE ALL CAREFULLY DOUBLE LOCKED THE WINDOWS WERE COVERED BY THEIR SHUTTERS AS THE EYES BY THEIR LIDS
6209-34600-0015 ALL ITS LETHARGIES MINGLE THEIR NIGHTMARES ITS SLUMBERS ARE A CROWD AND FROM ITS HUMAN BODIES LYING PRONE THERE ARISES A VAPOUR OF DREAMS SLEEP HAS GLOOMY ASSOCIATES BEYOND THIS LIFE
6209-34600-0016 THE DECOMPOSED THOUGHTS OF THE SLEEPERS FLOAT ABOVE THEM IN A MIST WHICH IS BOTH OF DEATH AND OF LIFE AND COMBINE WITH THE POSSIBLE WHICH HAS ALSO PERHAPS THE POWER OF THOUGHT AS IT FLOATS IN SPACE
6209-34600-0017 HENCE ARISE ENTANGLEMENTS DREAMS THOSE CLOUDS INTERPOSE THEIR FOLDS AND THEIR TRANSPARENCIES OVER THAT STAR THE MIND
6209-34600-0018 INTO IMPALPABILITY MYSTERIOUS DIFFUSED EXISTENCES AMALGAMATE THEMSELVES WITH LIFE ON THAT BORDER OF DEATH WHICH SLEEP IS THOSE LARVAE AND SOULS MINGLE IN THE AIR
6209-34600-0019 EVEN HE WHO SLEEPS NOT FEELS A MEDIUM PRESS UPON HIM FULL OF SINISTER LIFE THE SURROUNDING CHIMERA IN WHICH HE SUSPECTS A REALITY IMPEDES HIM THE WAKING MAN
6209-34600-0020 WENDING HIS WAY AMIDST THE SLEEP PHANTOMS OF OTHERS UNCONSCIOUSLY PUSHES BACK PASSING SHADOWS HAS OR IMAGINES THAT HE HAS A VAGUE FEAR OF ADVERSE CONTACT WITH THE INVISIBLE
6209-34600-0021 AND FEELS AT EVERY MOMENT THE OBSCURE PRESSURE OF A HOSTILE ENCOUNTER WHICH IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVES THERE IS SOMETHING OF THE EFFECT OF A FOREST IN THE NOCTURNAL DIFFUSION OF DREAMS THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED BEING AFRAID WITHOUT REASON
6209-34600-0022 WHAT A MAN FEELS A CHILD FEELS STILL MORE THE UNEASINESS OF NOCTURNAL FEAR INCREASED BY THE SPECTRAL HOUSES INCREASED THE WEIGHT OF THE SAD BURDEN UNDER WHICH HE WAS STRUGGLING
6209-34600-0023 WHICH HE TOOK FOR THE OCEAN HE NO LONGER KNEW IN WHAT DIRECTION THE SEA LAY HE RETRACED HIS STEPS STRUCK TO THE LEFT BY MAIDEN STREET AND RETURNED AS FAR AS SAINT ALBAN'S ROW
6209-34600-0024 THERE BY CHANCE AND WITHOUT SELECTION HE KNOCKED VIOLENTLY AT ANY HOUSE THAT HE HAPPENED TO PASS HIS BLOWS ON WHICH HE WAS EXPENDING HIS LAST ENERGIES WERE JERKY AND WITHOUT AIM NOW CEASING ALTOGETHER FOR A TIME
6209-34600-0025 ONE VOICE ANSWERED THAT OF TIME THREE O'CLOCK TOLLED SLOWLY BEHIND HIM FROM THE OLD BELFRY OF SAINT NICHOLAS THEN ALL SANK INTO SILENCE AGAIN
6209-34600-0026 THEY WERE JUST OVER A SOMEWHAT SEVERE OUTBREAK OF THE PLAGUE IN LONDON AND THAT THE FEAR OF RECEIVING SICK VAGABONDS CAUSED A DIMINUTION OF HOSPITALITY EVERYWHERE PEOPLE WOULD NOT EVEN OPEN THEIR WINDOWS FOR FEAR OF INHALING THE POISON
6209-34600-0027 THE CHILD FELT THE COLDNESS OF MEN MORE TERRIBLY THAN THE COLDNESS OF NIGHT
6209-34600-0028 THE PITILESS DESERT HE HAD UNDERSTOOD THE UNRELENTING TOWN WAS TOO MUCH TO BEAR THE HOUR THE STROKES OF WHICH HE HAD JUST COUNTED HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLOW
6209-34600-0029 NOTHING IS SO FREEZING IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS AS THE VOICE OF THE HOUR IT IS A DECLARATION OF INDIFFERENCE IT IS ETERNITY SAYING WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME HE STOPPED
6209-34600-0030 TO LIE DOWN THERE AND DIE HOWEVER THE LITTLE INFANT LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST HIS SHOULDER AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN THIS BLIND CONFIDENCE SET HIM ONWARDS AGAIN
6209-34600-0031 HE WHOM ALL SUPPORTS WERE FAILING FELT THAT HE WAS HIMSELF A BASIS OF SUPPORT IRRESISTIBLE SUMMONS OF DUTY NEITHER SUCH IDEAS NOR SUCH A SITUATION BELONGED TO HIS AGE
6209-34600-0032 HE DID WHAT HE CHANCED TO DO HE SET OUT AGAIN IN THE DIRECTION OF JOHNSTONE ROW BUT NOW HE NO LONGER WALKED HE DRAGGED HIMSELF ALONG HE LEFT SAINT MARY'S STREET TO THE LEFT MADE ZIGZAGS THROUGH LANES
6209-34600-0033 HE PERCEIVED THE SEA TO THE RIGHT AND SCARCELY ANYTHING MORE OF THE TOWN TO HIS LEFT WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HIM HERE WAS THE COUNTRY AGAIN TO THE EAST GREAT INCLINED PLANES OF SNOW MARKED OUT THE WIDE SLOPES OF RADIPOLE
6209-34600-0034 SHOULD HE CONTINUE THIS JOURNEY SHOULD HE ADVANCE AND RE ENTER THE SOLITUDES SHOULD HE RETURN AND RE ENTER THE STREETS WHAT WAS HE TO DO BETWEEN THOSE TWO SILENCES THE MUTE PLAIN AND THE DEAF CITY
6209-34600-0035 WHICH OF THE TWO REFUSALS SHOULD HE CHOOSE THERE IS THE ANCHOR OF MERCY THERE IS ALSO THE LOOK OF PITEOUSNESS IT WAS THAT LOOK WHICH THE POOR LITTLE DESPAIRING WANDERER THREW AROUND HIM
6209-34601-0000 MISANTHROPY PLAYS ITS PRANKS A STRANGE AND ALARMING GRINDING OF TEETH REACHED HIM THROUGH THE DARKNESS IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE BACK HE ADVANCED
6209-34601-0001 TO THOSE TO WHOM SILENCE HAS BECOME DREADFUL A HOWL IS COMFORTING THAT FIERCE GROWL REASSURED HIM THAT THREAT WAS A PROMISE THERE WAS THERE A BEING ALIVE AND AWAKE
6209-34601-0002 MADE BY THE REFLECTION OF SNOW AND SEA HE SAW A THING PLACED AS IF FOR SHELTER IT WAS A CART UNLESS IT WAS A HOVEL IT HAD WHEELS IT WAS A CARRIAGE IT HAD A ROOF IT WAS A DWELLING
6209-34601-0003 FROM THE ROOF AROSE A FUNNEL AND OUT OF THE FUNNEL SMOKE THIS SMOKE WAS RED AND SEEMED TO IMPLY A GOOD FIRE IN THE INTERIOR BEHIND PROJECTING HINGES INDICATED A DOOR
6209-34601-0004 AND IN THE CENTRE OF THIS DOOR A SQUARE OPENING SHOWED A LIGHT INSIDE THE CARAVAN HE APPROACHED
6209-34601-0005 AT THE SAME TIME AS THE MOUTH BETWEEN THE WHEELS A HEAD WAS PUT THROUGH THE WINDOW
6209-34601-0006 THE MOUTH WAS SILENT THE HEAD BEGAN AGAIN IS ANY ONE THERE THE CHILD ANSWERED YES WHO I YOU WHO ARE YOU WHENCE DO YOU COME
6209-34601-0007 I AM WEARY SAID THE CHILD WHAT O'CLOCK IS IT I AM COLD WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE I AM HUNGRY THE HEAD REPLIED
6209-34601-0008 THE CHILD BOWED HIS FOREHEAD DREW THE SLEEPING INFANT CLOSER IN HIS ARMS AND COLLECTED HIS STRENGTH TO RESUME HIS JOURNEY HE HAD TAKEN A FEW STEPS AND WAS HURRYING AWAY
6209-34601-0009 THE CHILD TURNED BACK
6209-34601-0010 RESUMED THE VOICE WHO HAS SENT ME A FELLOW LIKE THIS WHO IS HUNGRY AND COLD AND WHO DOES NOT COME IN THE CHILD AT ONCE REPULSED AND INVITED REMAINED MOTIONLESS THE VOICE CONTINUED
6209-34601-0011 YOU ARE TOLD TO COME IN YOU YOUNG RASCAL HE MADE UP HIS MIND AND PLACED ONE FOOT ON THE LOWEST STEP THERE WAS A GREAT GROWL UNDER THE VAN HE DREW BACK THE GAPING JAWS APPEARED
6209-34601-0012 CRIED THE VOICE OF THE MAN THE JAWS RETREATED THE GROWLING CEASED COME UP CONTINUED THE MAN THE CHILD WITH DIFFICULTY CLIMBED UP THE THREE STEPS HE WAS IMPEDED BY THE INFANT
6209-34601-0013 SO BENUMBED ROLLED UP AND ENVELOPED IN THE JACKET THAT NOTHING COULD BE DISTINGUISHED OF HER AND SHE WAS BUT A LITTLE SHAPELESS MASS HE PASSED OVER THE THREE STEPS AND HAVING REACHED THE THRESHOLD STOPPED
6209-34601-0014 NO CANDLE WAS BURNING IN THE CARAVAN PROBABLY FROM THE ECONOMY OF WANT THE HUT WAS LIGHTED ONLY BY A RED TINGE ARISING FROM THE OPENING AT THE TOP OF THE STOVE IN WHICH SPARKLED A PEAT FIRE
6209-34601-0015 ON THE STOVE WERE SMOKING A PORRINGER AND A SAUCEPAN CONTAINING TO ALL APPEARANCE SOMETHING TO EAT THE SAVOURY ODOUR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE HUT WAS FURNISHED WITH A CHEST
6209-34601-0016 BESIDES TO THE PARTITION WERE ATTACHED SOME BOARDS ON BRACKETS AND SOME HOOKS FROM WHICH HUNG A VARIETY OF THINGS ON THE BOARDS AND NAILS WERE ROWS OF GLASSES COPPERS AN ALEMBIC
6209-34601-0017 A VESSEL RATHER LIKE THOSE USED FOR GRAINING WAX WHICH ARE CALLED GRANULATORS AND A CONFUSION OF STRANGE OBJECTS OF WHICH THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AND WHICH WERE UTENSILS FOR COOKING AND CHEMISTRY THE CARAVAN WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE
6209-34601-0018 THE STOVE BEING IN FRONT IT WAS NOT EVEN A LITTLE ROOM IT WAS SCARCELY A BIG BOX THERE WAS MORE LIGHT OUTSIDE FROM THE SNOW THAN INSIDE FROM THE STOVE EVERYTHING IN THE CARAVAN WAS INDISTINCT AND MISTY
6209-34601-0019 NEVERTHELESS A REFLECTION OF THE FIRE ON THE CEILING ENABLED THE SPECTATOR TO READ IN LARGE LETTERS URSUS PHILOSOPHER THE CHILD IN FACT WAS ENTERING THE HOUSE OF HOMO AND URSUS
6209-34601-0020 THE ONE HE HAD JUST HEARD GROWLING THE OTHER SPEAKING THE CHILD HAVING REACHED THE THRESHOLD PERCEIVED NEAR THE STOVE A MAN TALL SMOOTH THIN AND OLD DRESSED IN GRAY WHOSE HEAD AS HE STOOD
6209-34601-0021 REACHED THE ROOF THE MAN COULD NOT HAVE RAISED HIMSELF ON TIPTOE THE CARAVAN WAS JUST HIS SIZE COME IN SAID THE MAN WHO WAS URSUS THE CHILD ENTERED PUT DOWN YOUR BUNDLE
6209-34601-0022 IS IT THAT YOU ARE AFRAID OF TEARING A HOLE IN YOUR RAGS WORTHLESS VAGABOND IN THE STREETS AT THIS HOUR WHO ARE YOU ANSWER BUT NO I FORBID YOU TO ANSWER THERE YOU ARE COLD
6209-34601-0023 AND WITH FEVERISH HASTE HE DRAGGED OFF THE BOY'S RAGS WHICH TORE INTO SHREDS WITH THE OTHER HE TOOK DOWN FROM A NAIL A MAN'S SHIRT AND ONE OF THOSE KNITTED JACKETS WHICH ARE UP TO THIS DAY CALLED KISS ME QUICKS HERE ARE CLOTHES
6209-34601-0024 AND CHAFED BEFORE THE FIRE THE LIMBS OF THE EXHAUSTED AND BEWILDERED CHILD WHO AT THAT MOMENT WARM AND NAKED FELT AS IF HE WERE SEEING AND TOUCHING HEAVEN THE LIMBS HAVING BEEN RUBBED HE NEXT WIPED THE BOY'S FEET
6209-34601-0025 AND THE MAN SLIPPED THE KNITTED JACKET OVER IT NOW THE MAN KICKED THE STOOL FORWARD AND MADE THE LITTLE BOY SIT DOWN AGAIN SHOVING HIM BY THE SHOULDERS THEN HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGER TO THE PORRINGER WHICH WAS SMOKING UPON THE STOVE
6209-34601-0026 WHAT THE CHILD SAW IN THE PORRINGER WAS AGAIN HEAVEN TO HIM NAMELY A POTATO AND A BIT OF BACON YOU ARE HUNGRY
6209-34601-0027 THE MAN TOOK FROM THE SHELF A CRUST OF HARD BREAD AND AN IRON FORK AND HANDED THEM TO THE CHILD THE BOY HESITATED PERHAPS YOU EXPECT ME TO LAY THE CLOTH SAID THE MAN AND HE PLACED THE PORRINGER ON THE CHILD'S LAP

6209-34601-0030 FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS ABSORBED BY TWO EXIGENCIES AND BY TWO ECSTASIES FOOD AND WARMTH URSUS CONTINUED HIS IMPRECATIONS MUTTERING TO HIMSELF
6209-34601-0031 I HAVE SEEN KING JAMES SUPPING IN PROPRIA PERSONA IN THE BANQUETING HOUSE WHERE ARE TO BE ADMIRED THE PAINTINGS OF THE FAMOUS RUBENS HIS MAJESTY TOUCHED NOTHING THIS BEGGAR HERE BROWSES
