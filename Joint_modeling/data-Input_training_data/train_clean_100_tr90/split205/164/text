6476-57446-0073 AND IF THEY ARE VERY POOR THEY WANDER FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE WORKING AS COBBLERS MENDING OLD SHOES AND LEATHER AND SO EARN A SCANTY LIVELIHOOD BESIDES THIS THEIR DAUGHTERS AND YOUNG MARRIED WOMEN GAIN A TRIFLE AS WANDERING MINSTRELS CALLED TORIOI
6476-57446-0074 PLAYING ON THE SHAMISEN A SORT OF BANJO AND SINGING BALLADS THEY NEVER MARRY OUT OF THEIR OWN FRATERNITY BUT REMAIN APART A DESPISED AND SHUNNED RACE AT EXECUTIONS BY CRUCIFIXION
6476-57446-0075 AND BESIDES THIS THEY HAVE TO PERFORM ALL SORTS OF DEGRADING OFFICES ABOUT CRIMINALS SUCH AS CARRYING SICK PRISONERS FROM THEIR CELLS TO THE HALL OF JUSTICE AND BURYING THE BODIES OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
6476-57446-0076 THUS THEIR RACE IS POLLUTED AND ACCURSED AND THEY ARE HATED ACCORDINGLY NOW THIS IS HOW THE ETAS CAME TO BE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF DANZAYEMON WHEN MINAMOTO NO YORITOMO WAS YET A CHILD HIS FATHER MINAMOTO NO YOSHITOMO
6476-57446-0077 BUT KIYOMORI DESIRING TO DESTROY THE FAMILY OF YOSHITOMO ROOT AND BRANCH ORDERED HIS RETAINERS TO DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO BANDS AND SEEK OUT THE CHILDREN AT LAST THEY WERE FOUND BUT TOKIWA WAS SO EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL
6476-57446-0078 THAT KIYOMORI WAS INFLAMED WITH LOVE FOR HER AND DESIRED HER TO BECOME HIS OWN CONCUBINE THEN TOKIWA TOLD KIYOMORI THAT IF HE WOULD SPARE HER LITTLE ONES SHE WOULD SHARE HIS COUCH
6476-57446-0079 BUT THAT IF HE KILLED HER CHILDREN SHE WOULD DESTROY HERSELF RATHER THAN YIELD TO HIS DESIRE WHEN HE HEARD THIS KIYOMORI BEWILDERED BY THE BEAUTY OF TOKIWA SPARED THE LIVES OF HER CHILDREN BUT BANISHED THEM FROM THE CAPITAL
6476-57446-0080 AND WHEN HE GREW UP AND BECAME A MAN HE MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A PEASANT AFTER A WHILE YORITOMO LEFT THE PROVINCE AND WENT TO THE WARS LEAVING HIS WIFE PREGNANT AND IN DUE TIME SHE WAS DELIVERED OF A MALE CHILD
6476-57446-0081 TO THE DELIGHT OF HER PARENTS WHO REJOICED THAT THEIR DAUGHTER SHOULD BEAR SEED TO A NOBLEMAN BUT SHE SOON FELL SICK AND DIED AND THE OLD PEOPLE TOOK CHARGE OF THE BABE AND WHEN THEY ALSO DIED THE CARE OF THE CHILD FELL TO HIS MOTHER'S KINSMEN
6476-57446-0082 AND HE GREW UP TO BE A PEASANT NOW KIYOMORI THE ENEMY OF YORITOMO HAD BEEN GATHERED TO HIS FATHERS AND YORITOMO HAD AVENGED THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER BY SLAYING MUNEMORI THE SON OF KIYOMORI AND THERE WAS PEACE THROUGHOUT THE LAND
6476-57446-0083 AND YORITOMO BECAME THE CHIEF OF ALL THE NOBLE HOUSES IN JAPAN AND FIRST ESTABLISHED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY WHEN YORITOMO HAD THUS RAISED HIMSELF TO POWER
6476-57446-0084 AND HIS DESCENDANTS AFTER HIM LIVED AS PEASANTS IN THE SAME VILLAGE INCREASING IN PROSPERITY AND IN GOOD REPUTE AMONG THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THE PRINCELY LINE OF YORITOMO CAME TO AN END IN THREE GENERATIONS
6476-57446-0085 SO HE SUMMONED HIM AND SAID IT IS A HARD THING TO SEE THE SON OF AN ILLUSTRIOUS HOUSE LIVE AND DIE A PEASANT I WILL PROMOTE YOU TO THE RANK OF SAMURAI THEN THE PEASANT ANSWERED MY LORD
6476-57446-0086 IF I BECOME A SAMURAI AND THE RETAINER OF SOME NOBLE I SHALL NOT BE SO HAPPY AS WHEN I WAS MY OWN MASTER IF I MAY NOT REMAIN A HUSBANDMAN LET ME BE A CHIEF OVER MEN HOWEVER HUMBLE THEY MAY BE
6476-57446-0087 AND THINKING TO PUNISH THE PEASANT FOR HIS INSOLENCE SAID
6476-96661-0000 AND THEIR MOTHER WAS LEDA WHO AFTER THE TWIN BROTHERS HAD ANOTHER CHILD BORN TO HER HELEN FOR WHOSE SAKE THE SONS OF MANY OF JASON'S FRIENDS WERE TO WAGE WAR AGAINST THE GREAT CITY OF TROY
6476-96661-0001 IN QUEST OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND THEN THERE CAME ONE WHO HAD BOTH WELCOME AND REVERENCE FROM JASON THIS ONE CAME WITHOUT SPEAR OR BOW BEARING IN HIS HANDS A LYRE ONLY HE WAS ORPHEUS
6476-96661-0002 AND HE KNEW ALL THE WAYS OF THE GODS AND ALL THE STORIES OF THE GODS WHEN HE SANG TO HIS LYRE THE TREES WOULD LISTEN AND THE BEASTS WOULD FOLLOW HIM
6476-96661-0003 CHIRON THE CENTAUR HAD MET HIM AS HE WAS WANDERING THROUGH THE FORESTS ON THE MOUNTAIN PELION AND HAD SENT HIM DOWN INTO IOLCUS THEN THERE CAME TWO MEN WELL SKILLED IN THE HANDLING OF SHIPS TIPHYS AND NAUPLIUS
6476-96661-0004 TIPHYS KNEW ALL ABOUT THE SUN AND WINDS AND STARS AND ALL ABOUT THE SIGNS BY WHICH A SHIP MIGHT BE STEERED AND NAUPLIUS HAD THE LOVE OF POSEIDON THE GOD OF THE SEA AFTERWARD THERE CAME ONE AFTER THE OTHER
6476-96661-0005 TWO WHO WERE FAMOUS FOR THEIR HUNTING NO TWO COULD BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN THESE TWO WERE THE FIRST WAS ARCAS HE WAS DRESSED IN THE SKIN OF A BEAR HE HAD RED HAIR AND SAVAGE LOOKING EYES
6476-96661-0006 AND FOR ARMS HE CARRIED A MIGHTY BOW WITH BRONZE TIPPED ARROWS THE FOLK WERE WATCHING AN EAGLE AS HE CAME INTO THE CITY AN EAGLE THAT WAS WINGING ITS WAY FAR FAR UP IN THE SKY ARCAS DREW HIS BOW AND WITH ONE ARROW HE BROUGHT THE EAGLE DOWN
6476-96661-0007 AND THEN HE WAS THE OLDEST OF THE HEROES IN THE CAMP OF AGAMEMNON TWO BROTHERS CAME WHO WERE TO BE SPECIAL FRIENDS OF JASON'S PELEUS AND TELAMON BOTH WERE STILL YOUTHFUL AND NEITHER HAD YET ACHIEVED ANY NOTABLE DEED
6476-96661-0008 ANOTHER WHO CAME WAS ADMETUS AFTERWARD HE BECAME A FAMOUS KING THE GOD APOLLO ONCE MADE HIMSELF A SHEPHERD AND HE KEPT THE FLOCKS OF KING ADMETUS AND THERE CAME TWO BROTHERS TWINS WHO WERE A WONDER TO ALL WHO BEHELD THEM
6476-96661-0009 THEIR MOTHER WAS OREITHYIA THE DAUGHTER OF ERECHTHEUS KING OF ATHENS AND THEIR FATHER WAS BOREAS THE NORTH WIND THESE TWO BROTHERS HAD ON THEIR ANKLES WINGS THAT GLEAMED WITH GOLDEN SCALES THEIR BLACK HAIR WAS THICK UPON THEIR SHOULDERS
6476-96661-0010 WHOSE NAME WAS THESEUS THESEUS'S FATHER WAS AN UNKNOWN KING HE HAD BIDDEN THE MOTHER SHOW THEIR SON WHERE HIS SWORD WAS HIDDEN UNDER A GREAT STONE THE KING HAD HIDDEN IT BEFORE THESEUS WAS BORN
6476-96661-0011 ON THE DAY THAT THE MESSENGERS HAD SET OUT TO BRING THROUGH GREECE THE WORD OF JASON'S GOING FORTH IN QUEST OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE
6476-96661-0012 THEY BEGAN TO FELL TREES FOR THE TIMBERS OF THE SHIP THAT WAS TO MAKE THE VOYAGE TO FAR COLCHIS
6476-96661-0013 THE HARBOR OF IOLCUS ON THE NIGHT OF THE DAY HE HAD HELPED TO BRING THEM DOWN JASON HAD A DREAM HE DREAMT THAT SHE WHOM HE HAD SEEN IN THE FOREST WAYS AND AFTERWARD BY THE RIVER ANAURUS APPEARED TO HIM
6476-96661-0014 HE WENT TO THE CITY'S GATE AND HE MET SUCH A MAN ARGUS WAS HIS NAME HE TOLD JASON THAT A DREAM HAD SENT HIM TO THE CITY OF IOLCUS JASON WELCOMED HIM AND LODGED HIM IN THE KING'S PALACE
6476-96661-0015 JASON HAD THEM TAKE THE BEAM FROM THE ROOF OF THE PALACE
6476-96661-0016 AND THAT DAY THE BUILDING OF THE GREAT SHIP WAS BEGUN
6476-96661-0017 CAME THE NOISE OF HAMMERING IN THE STREET WHERE THE METALWORKERS WERE CAME THE NOISE OF BEATING UPON METALS AS THE SMITHS FASHIONED OUT OF BRONZE ARMOR FOR THE HEROES AND SWORDS AND SPEARS EVERY DAY
6476-96661-0018 UNDER THE EYES OF ARGUS THE MASTER THE SHIP THAT HAD IN IT THE BEAM FROM ZEUS'S GROVE WAS BUILT HIGHER AND WIDER AND THOSE WHO WERE BUILDING THE SHIP OFTEN FELT GOING THROUGH IT TREMORS AS OF A LIVING CREATURE
6476-96661-0019 WHEN THE SHIP WAS BUILT AND MADE READY FOR THE VOYAGE A NAME WAS GIVEN TO IT THE ARGO IT WAS CALLED
6476-96661-0020 ALL WAS READY FOR THE VOYAGE AND NOW JASON WENT WITH HIS FRIENDS TO VIEW THE SHIP BEFORE SHE WAS BROUGHT INTO THE WATER ARGUS THE MASTER WAS ON THE SHIP SEEING TO IT THAT THE LAST THINGS WERE BEING DONE BEFORE ARGO WAS LAUNCHED
6476-96661-0021 VERY GRAVE AND WISE LOOKED ARGUS ARGUS THE BUILDER OF THE SHIP AND WONDERFUL TO THE HEROES THE SHIP LOOKED NOW THAT ARGUS FOR THEIR VIEWING HAD SET UP THE MAST WITH THE SAILS AND HAD EVEN PUT THE OARS IN THEIR PLACES
6476-96661-0022 WONDERFUL TO THE HEROES ARGO LOOKED WITH HER LONG OARS AND HER HIGH SAILS WITH HER TIMBERS PAINTED RED AND GOLD AND BLUE AND WITH A MARVELOUS FIGURE CARVED UPON HER PROW ALL OVER THE SHIP JASON'S EYES WENT
6476-96661-0023 HE SAW A FIGURE STANDING BY THE MAST FOR A MOMENT HE LOOKED ON IT AND THEN THE FIGURE BECAME SHADOWY
6476-96661-0024 THEN MAST AND SAILS WERE TAKEN DOWN AND THE OARS WERE LEFT IN THE SHIP AND THE ARGO WAS LAUNCHED INTO THE WATER THE HEROES WENT BACK TO THE PALACE OF KING PELIAS TO FEAST WITH THE KING'S GUESTS BEFORE THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES ON THE SHIP
6476-96661-0025 SETTING OUT ON THE VOYAGE TO FAR COLCHIS WHEN THEY CAME INTO THE PALACE THEY SAW THAT ANOTHER HERO HAD ARRIVED HIS SHIELD WAS HUNG IN THE HALL THE HEROES ALL GATHERED AROUND AMAZED AT THE SIZE AND THE BEAUTY OF IT
6476-96661-0026 STRIFE AND PURSUIT AND FLIGHT TUMULT AND PANIC AND SLAUGHTER THE FIGURE OF FATE WAS THERE DRAGGING A DEAD MAN BY THE FEET
6476-96661-0027 AROUND THESE FIGURES WERE HEADS OF SNAKES HEADS WITH BLACK JAWS AND GLITTERING EYES TWELVE HEADS SUCH AS MIGHT AFFRIGHT ANY MAN
6476-96661-0028 THERE WERE MEN FIGHTING AND WOMEN WATCHING FROM HIGH TOWERS THE AWFUL FIGURE OF THE DARKNESS OF DEATH WAS SHOWN THERE TOO WITH MOURNFUL EYES AND THE DUST OF BATTLES UPON HER SHOULDERS THE OUTER RIM OF THE SHIELD
6476-96661-0029 SHOWED THE STREAM OF OCEAN THE STREAM THAT ENCIRCLES THE WORLD SWANS WERE SOARING ABOVE AND SWIMMING ON ITS SURFACE ALL IN WONDER THE HEROES GAZED ON THE GREAT SHIELD TELLING EACH OTHER THAT ONLY ONE MAN IN ALL THE WORLD COULD CARRY IT
6529-62554-0000 SO THEN ALL WAS EXPLAINED BY THE SUBMARINE EXPLOSION OF THIS TORPEDO CYRUS HARDING COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS DURING THE WAR OF THE UNION HE HAD HAD OCCASION TO TRY THESE TERRIBLE ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION
6529-62554-0001 OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL OF THE SAME NATURE THAT THE WATER OF THE CHANNEL HAD BEEN RAISED LIKE A DOME THE BOTTOM OF THE BRIG CRUSHED IN AND SHE HAD SUNK INSTANTLY THE DAMAGE DONE TO HER HULL
6529-62554-0002 THE SPEEDY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO WITHSTAND A TORPEDO THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED AN IRONCLAD AS EASILY AS A FISHING BOAT YES ALL WAS EXPLAINED EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE PRESENCE OF THE TORPEDO IN THE WATERS OF THE CHANNEL
6529-62554-0003 AND I SAY THIS IN ORDER THAT AYRTON MAY BE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE STRANGE EVENTS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED DURING THESE TWO YEARS WHO THIS BENEFICENT STRANGER IS WHOSE INTERVENTION HAS SO FORTUNATELY FOR US BEEN MANIFESTED ON MANY OCCASIONS I CANNOT IMAGINE
6529-62554-0004 WHAT HIS OBJECT CAN BE IN ACTING THUS IN CONCEALING HIMSELF AFTER RENDERING US SO MANY SERVICES I CANNOT UNDERSTAND BUT HIS SERVICES ARE NOT THE LESS REAL
6529-62554-0005 AND ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT ONLY A MAN POSSESSED OF PRODIGIOUS POWER COULD RENDER THEM AYRTON IS INDEBTED TO HIM AS MUCH AS WE ARE FOR IF IT WAS THE STRANGER WHO SAVED ME FROM THE WAVES AFTER THE FALL FROM THE BALLOON
6529-62554-0006 THAT IT WAS HE WHO LIGHTED THAT FIRE ON THE HEIGHTS OF THE ISLAND WHICH PERMITTED YOU TO LAND THAT IT WAS HE WHO FIRED THAT BULLET FOUND IN THE BODY OF THE PECCARY THAT IT WAS HE WHO PLUNGED THAT TORPEDO INTO THE CHANNEL WHICH DESTROYED THE BRIG
6529-62554-0007 IN A WORD THAT ALL THOSE INEXPLICABLE EVENTS FOR WHICH WE COULD NOT ASSIGN A REASON ARE DUE TO THIS MYSTERIOUS BEING THEREFORE WHOEVER HE MAY BE WHETHER SHIPWRECKED OR EXILED ON OUR ISLAND WE SHALL BE UNGRATEFUL IF WE THINK OURSELVES FREED FROM GRATITUDE TOWARDS HIM
6529-62554-0008 WE HAVE CONTRACTED A DEBT AND I HOPE THAT WE SHALL ONE DAY PAY IT YOU ARE RIGHT IN SPEAKING THUS MY DEAR CYRUS REPLIED GIDEON SPILETT YES THERE IS AN ALMOST ALL POWERFUL BEING HIDDEN IN SOME PART OF THE ISLAND
6529-62554-0009 AND WHOSE INFLUENCE HAS BEEN SINGULARLY USEFUL TO OUR COLONY I WILL ADD THAT THE UNKNOWN APPEARS TO POSSESS MEANS OF ACTION WHICH BORDER ON THE SUPERNATURAL IF IN THE EVENTS OF PRACTICAL LIFE THE SUPERNATURAL WERE RECOGNIZABLE
6529-62554-0010 IS IT HE WHO IS IN SECRET COMMUNICATION WITH US BY THE WELL IN GRANITE HOUSE AND HAS HE THUS A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL OUR PLANS WAS IT HE WHO THREW US THAT BOTTLE WHEN THE VESSEL MADE HER FIRST CRUISE
6529-62554-0011 WAS IT HE WHO THREW TOP OUT OF THE LAKE AND KILLED THE DUGONG WAS IT HE WHO AS EVERYTHING LEADS US TO BELIEVE SAVED YOU FROM THE WAVES AND THAT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH ANY ONE ELSE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACT IF IT WAS HE
6529-62554-0012 HE POSSESSES A POWER WHICH RENDERS HIM MASTER OF THE ELEMENTS THE REPORTER'S REASONING WAS JUST AND EVERY ONE FELT IT TO BE SO YES REJOINED CYRUS HARDING
6529-62554-0013 IF THE INTERVENTION OF A HUMAN BEING IS NOT MORE QUESTIONABLE FOR US I AGREE THAT HE HAS AT HIS DISPOSAL MEANS OF ACTION BEYOND THOSE POSSESSED BY HUMANITY THERE IS A MYSTERY STILL BUT IF WE DISCOVER THE MAN THE MYSTERY WILL BE DISCOVERED ALSO THE QUESTION THEN IS
6529-62554-0014 WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE MATTER MY OPINION SAID PENCROFT IS THAT WHOEVER HE MAY BE HE IS A BRAVE MAN AND HE HAS MY ESTEEM BE IT SO ANSWERED HARDING BUT THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER PENCROFT
6529-62554-0015 MASTER THEN SAID NEBRASKA MY IDEA IS THAT WE MAY SEARCH AS LONG AS WE LIKE FOR THIS GENTLEMAN WHOM YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT THAT WE SHALL NOT DISCOVER HIM TILL HE PLEASES THAT'S NOT BAD WHAT YOU SAY NEBRASKA OBSERVED PENCROFT
6529-62554-0016 I AM OF NEB'S OPINION SAID GIDEON SPILETT BUT THAT IS NO REASON FOR NOT ATTEMPTING THE ADVENTURE WHETHER WE FIND THIS MYSTERIOUS BEING OR NOT WE SHALL AT LEAST HAVE FULFILLED OUR DUTY TOWARDS HIM
6529-62554-0017 AND YOU MY BOY GIVE US YOUR OPINION SAID THE ENGINEER TURNING TO HERBERT OH CRIED HERBERT HIS COUNTENANCE FULL OF ANIMATION HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO THANK HIM HE WHO SAVED YOU FIRST AND WHO HAS NOW SAVED US
6529-62554-0018 OF COURSE MY BOY REPLIED PENCROFT SO WOULD I AND ALL OF US I AM NOT INQUISITIVE BUT I WOULD GIVE ONE OF MY EYES TO SEE THIS INDIVIDUAL FACE TO FACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE MUST BE HANDSOME TALL STRONG WITH A SPLENDID BEARD RADIANT HAIR
6529-62554-0019 BUT PENCROFT ANSWERED SPILETT YOU ARE DESCRIBING A PICTURE OF THE CREATOR POSSIBLY MISTER SPILETT REPLIED THE SAILOR BUT THAT IS HOW I IMAGINE HIM AND YOU AYRTON ASKED THE ENGINEER CAPTAIN HARDING REPLIED AYRTON
6529-62554-0020 YOU ARE OUR COMPANION YOU HAVE ALREADY ENDANGERED YOUR LIFE SEVERAL TIMES FOR US AND YOU AS WELL AS THE REST OUGHT TO BE CONSULTED IN THE MATTER OF ANY IMPORTANT DECISION SPEAK THEREFORE CAPTAIN HARDING REPLIED AYRTON
6529-62554-0021 I TOO AS YOU SAID HAVE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO PAY HIM IT WAS HE IT COULD BE ONLY HE WHO MUST HAVE COME TO TABOR ISLAND WHO FOUND THERE THE WRETCH YOU KNEW AND WHO MADE KNOWN TO YOU THAT THERE WAS AN UNFORTUNATE MAN THERE TO BE SAVED
6529-62554-0022 THEREFORE IT IS THANKS TO HIM THAT I HAVE BECOME A MAN AGAIN NO I WILL NEVER FORGET HIM THAT IS SETTLED THEN SAID CYRUS HARDING WE WILL BEGIN OUR RESEARCHES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WE WILL NOT LEAVE A CORNER OF THE ISLAND UNEXPLORED
6529-62554-0023 WE WILL SEARCH INTO ITS MOST SECRET RECESSES AND WILL HOPE THAT OUR UNKNOWN FRIEND WILL PARDON US IN CONSIDERATION OF OUR INTENTIONS FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE COLONISTS WERE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED IN HAYMAKING AND THE HARVEST
6529-62554-0024 BEFORE PUTTING THEIR PROJECT OF EXPLORING THE YET UNKNOWN PARTS OF THE ISLAND INTO EXECUTION THEY WISHED TO GET ALL POSSIBLE WORK FINISHED IT WAS ALSO THE TIME FOR COLLECTING THE VARIOUS VEGETABLES FROM THE TABOR ISLAND PLANTS ALL WAS STOWED AWAY
6529-62554-0025 AND HAPPILY THERE WAS NO WANT OF ROOM IN GRANITE HOUSE IN WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE HOUSED ALL THE TREASURES OF THE ISLAND THE PRODUCTS OF THE COLONY WERE THERE METHODICALLY ARRANGED AND IN A SAFE PLACE AS MAY BE BELIEVED SHELTERED AS MUCH FROM ANIMALS AS FROM MAN
6529-62554-0026 THERE WAS NO FEAR OF DAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT THICK MASS OF GRANITE MANY NATURAL EXCAVATIONS SITUATED IN THE UPPER PASSAGE WERE ENLARGED EITHER BY PICK AXE OR MINE AND GRANITE HOUSE THUS BECAME A GENERAL WAREHOUSE
6529-62554-0027 CONTAINING ALL THE PROVISIONS ARMS TOOLS AND SPARE UTENSILS IN A WORD ALL THE STORES OF THE COLONY AS TO THE GUNS OBTAINED FROM THE BRIG THEY WERE PRETTY PIECES OF ORDNANCE WHICH AT PENCROFT'S ENTREATY
6529-62554-0028 WERE HOISTED BY MEANS OF TACKLE AND PULLEYS RIGHT UP INTO GRANITE HOUSE EMBRASURES WERE MADE BETWEEN THE WINDOWS AND THE SHINING MUZZLES OF THE GUNS COULD SOON BE SEEN THROUGH THE GRANITE CLIFF FROM THIS HEIGHT THEY COMMANDED ALL UNION BAY
6529-62554-0029 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING IF WE TRIED THE RANGE OF OUR GUNS DO YOU THINK THAT IS USEFUL ASKED THE ENGINEER IT IS MORE THAN USEFUL IT IS NECESSARY WITHOUT THAT HOW ARE WE TO KNOW TO WHAT DISTANCE WE CAN SEND ONE OF THOSE PRETTY SHOT WITH WHICH WE ARE PROVIDED
6529-62554-0030 TRY THEM PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER HOWEVER I THINK THAT IN MAKING THE EXPERIMENT WE OUGHT TO EMPLOY
6529-62554-0031 BUT THE PYROXYLE WHICH WILL NEVER FAIL US CAN THE CANNON SUPPORT THE SHOCK OF THE PYROXYLE ASKED THE REPORTER WHO WAS NOT LESS ANXIOUS THAN PENCROFT TO TRY THE ARTILLERY OF GRANITE HOUSE I BELIEVE SO HOWEVER ADDED THE ENGINEER WE WILL BE PRUDENT
6529-62554-0032 THE TRANSIT DESCRIBED BY THE BALL OUGHT TO BE AS EXTENDED AS POSSIBLE AND THIS TENSION COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THE PROJECTILE SHOULD BE IMPELLED WITH A VERY GREAT INITIAL VELOCITY NOW SAID HARDING TO HIS COMPANIONS
6529-62554-0033 THE INITIAL VELOCITY IS IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY OF POWDER USED IN THE FABRICATION OF THESE PIECES EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON EMPLOYING A METAL WITH THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE POWER OF RESISTANCE AND STEEL IS INCONTESTABLY THAT METAL OF ALL OTHERS WHICH RESISTS THE BEST
6529-62554-0034 I HAVE THEREFORE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT OUR GUNS WILL BEAR WITHOUT RISK THE EXPANSION OF THE PYROXYLE GAS AND WILL GIVE EXCELLENT RESULTS WE SHALL BE A GREAT DEAL MORE CERTAIN OF THAT WHEN WE HAVE TRIED THEM ANSWERED PENCROFT
6529-62554-0035 IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY THAT THE FOUR CANNONS WERE IN PERFECT ORDER SINCE THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE WATER THE SAILOR HAD BESTOWED GREAT CARE UPON THEM HOW MANY HOURS HE HAD SPENT IN RUBBING GREASING AND POLISHING THEM AND IN CLEANING THE MECHANISM
6529-62554-0036 AND NOW THE PIECES WERE AS BRILLIANT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ON BOARD A FRIGATE OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY ON THIS DAY THEREFORE IN PRESENCE OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COLONY INCLUDING MASTER JUP AND TOP THE FOUR CANNON WERE SUCCESSIVELY TRIED
6529-62554-0037 THEY WERE CHARGED WITH PYROXYLE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ITS EXPLOSIVE POWER WHICH AS HAS BEEN SAID IS FOUR TIMES THAT OF ORDINARY POWDER THE PROJECTILE TO BE FIRED WAS CYLINDROCONIC PENCROFT HOLDING THE END OF THE QUICK MATCH
6529-62554-0038 SUCH A SHOT THE HONOR OF WHICH BELONGED TO HIS DEAR BOY THE THIRD SHOT AIMED THIS TIME AT THE DOWNS FORMING THE UPPER SIDE OF UNION BAY STRUCK THE SAND AT A DISTANCE OF FOUR MILES THEN HAVING RICOCHETED WAS LOST IN THE SEA IN A CLOUD OF SPRAY
6529-62554-0039 FOR THE FOURTH PIECE CYRUS HARDING SLIGHTLY INCREASED THE CHARGE SO AS TO TRY ITS EXTREME RANGE THEN ALL STANDING ASIDE FOR FEAR OF ITS BURSTING THE MATCH WAS LIGHTED BY MEANS OF A LONG CORD
6529-62554-0040 A TREMENDOUS REPORT WAS HEARD BUT THE PIECE HAD HELD GOOD AND THE COLONISTS RUSHING TO THE WINDOWS SAW THE SHOT GRAZE THE ROCKS OF MANDIBLE CAPE NEARLY FIVE MILES FROM GRANITE HOUSE AND DISAPPEAR IN SHARK GULF
6529-62554-0041 BELIEVE ME PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO HAVE TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENT WELL SAID THE SAILOR WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE WITH REGARD TO THOSE SIX VILLAINS WHO ARE ROAMING ABOUT THE ISLAND
6529-62554-0042 ARE WE TO LEAVE THEM TO OVERRUN OUR FORESTS OUR FIELDS OUR PLANTATIONS THESE PIRATES ARE REGULAR JAGUARS AND IT SEEMS TO ME WE OUGHT NOT TO HESITATE TO TREAT THEM AS SUCH
6529-62554-0043 TURNING TO HIS COMPANION AYRTON HESITATED AT FIRST TO REPLY AND CYRUS HARDING REGRETTED THAT PENCROFT HAD SO THOUGHTLESSLY PUT THIS QUESTION AND HE WAS MUCH MOVED WHEN AYRTON REPLIED IN A HUMBLE TONE
6529-62554-0044 HE HAS AS MUCH RIGHT TO SPEAK HERE AS ANY ONE YES SAID GIDEON SPILETT BUT HIS RESERVE DOES HIM HONOR AND IT IS RIGHT TO RESPECT THE FEELING WHICH HE HAS ABOUT HIS SAD PAST CERTAINLY MISTER SPILETT ANSWERED THE SAILOR
6529-62554-0045 IS THAT YOUR OPINION PENCROFT ASKED THE ENGINEER QUITE MY OPINION AND BEFORE HUNTING THEM MERCILESSLY YOU WOULD NOT WAIT UNTIL THEY HAD COMMITTED SOME FRESH ACT OF HOSTILITY AGAINST US
6529-62554-0046 PENCROFT THINK OF AYRTON SAID HERBERT TAKING THE SAILOR'S HAND HE BECAME AN HONEST MAN AGAIN PENCROFT LOOKED AT HIS COMPANIONS ONE AFTER THE OTHER HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HIS PROPOSAL BEING MET WITH ANY OBJECTION
6529-62554-0047 HIS ROUGH NATURE COULD NOT ALLOW THAT THEY OUGHT TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE RASCALS WHO HAD LANDED ON THE ISLAND WITH BOB HARVEY'S ACCOMPLICES THE MURDERERS OF THE CREW OF THE SPEEDY AND HE LOOKED UPON THEM AS WILD BEASTS WHICH OUGHT TO BE DESTROYED WITHOUT DELAY AND WITHOUT REMORSE
6529-62554-0048 YOU WISH TO BE GENEROUS TO THOSE VILLAINS VERY WELL I HOPE WE MAYN'T REPENT IT WHAT DANGER SHALL WE RUN SAID HERBERT IF WE TAKE CARE TO BE ALWAYS ON OUR GUARD HUM OBSERVED THE REPORTER WHO HAD NOT GIVEN ANY DECIDED OPINION
6529-62554-0049 THEY ARE SIX AND WELL ARMED IF THEY EACH LAY HID IN A CORNER AND EACH FIRED AT ONE OF US THEY WOULD SOON BE MASTERS OF THE COLONY WHY HAVE THEY NOT DONE SO SAID HERBERT NO DOUBT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THEIR INTEREST TO DO IT BESIDES WE ARE SIX ALSO
6529-62554-0050 WELL WELL REPLIED PENCROFT WHOM NO REASONING COULD HAVE CONVINCED LET US LEAVE THESE GOOD PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY LIKE AND DON'T THINK ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM COME PENCROFT SAID NEBRASKA DON'T MAKE YOURSELF OUT SO BAD AS ALL THAT
6529-62554-0051 SUPPOSE ONE OF THESE UNFORTUNATE MEN WERE HERE BEFORE YOU WITHIN GOOD RANGE OF YOUR GUNS YOU WOULD NOT FIRE I WOULD FIRE ON HIM AS I WOULD ON A MAD DOG NEBRASKA REPLIED PENCROFT COLDLY PENCROFT SAID THE ENGINEER
6529-62554-0052 YOU HAVE ALWAYS SHOWN MUCH DEFERENCE TO MY ADVICE WILL YOU IN THIS MATTER YIELD TO ME I WILL DO AS YOU PLEASE CAPTAIN HARDING ANSWERED THE SAILOR WHO WAS NOT AT ALL CONVINCED VERY WELL WAIT
6529-62554-0053 AND WE WILL NOT ATTACK THEM UNLESS WE ARE ATTACKED FIRST THUS THEIR BEHAVIOR TOWARDS THE PIRATES WAS AGREED UPON ALTHOUGH PENCROFT AUGURED NOTHING GOOD FROM IT THEY WERE NOT TO ATTACK THEM BUT WERE TO BE ON THEIR GUARD
6529-62554-0054 AFTER ALL THE ISLAND WAS LARGE AND FERTILE IF ANY SENTIMENT OF HONESTY YET REMAINED IN THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEARTS THESE WRETCHES MIGHT PERHAPS BE RECLAIMED WAS IT NOT THEIR INTEREST IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES TO BEGIN A NEW LIFE
