696-93314-0039 BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE ME UP IF I WON'T BE GIVEN UP CAN YOU HIS SMILE STRUCK HER DUMB IT WAS MORE CONVINCING THAN HIS WORDS
696-93314-0040 YOU'LL FORGIVE ME WON'T YOU I DIDN'T KNOW AND OH WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING YET THEY TALKED FOR HOURS CONVENTIONALLY HE SHOULD HAVE TORN HIMSELF AWAY UNABLE TO BEAR THE STRAIN OF HIS AGONY
696-93314-0041 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE SAT BY HER HOLDING HER HAND IT WAS FOR THE LAST TIME THE LAST LAST TIME THERE WAS REALLY A THIRD AT THAT INTERVIEW THE ONLOOKER HAD IMAGINATION ENOUGH TO SEE THE SCENE BETWEEN THE PARTING LOVERS
696-93314-0042 THEY PARTED AND NOW THE ONLOOKER DARED NOT MEET HER DARED NOT CALL AT THE HOUSE AS HE HAD USED TO DO AT LAST THE FATHER PRESSED HIM HE WENT HE MET HER AND IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD MET THE GHOST OF HER WHOM HE HAD LOVED
696-93314-0043 HER EYES HAD BLUE MARKS UNDER THEM HER CHIN HAD GROWN MORE POINTED HER NOSE SHARPER THERE WAS A NEW LINE ON HER FOREHEAD AND HER EYES HAD CHANGED OVER THE WINE HE HEARD FROM THE FATHER THAT SHE WAS PINING FOR THE LOVER WHO HAD INHERITED HEART DISEASE
696-93314-0044 I SUPPOSE IT WAS YOU WHO SAW HIM BY THE WAY SAID HE A TALL WELL SET UP YOUNG FELLOW DARK NOT BAD LOOKING I I DON'T REMEMBER LIED THE ONLOOKER
696-93314-0045 WITH THE EYES OF HIS MEMORY ON THE WHITE FACE OF THE MAN HE HAD STABBED NOW THE LOVER AND THE ONLOOKER HAD EACH HIS OWN BURDEN TO BEAR AND THE LOVER'S WAS THE EASIER HE WORKED STILL THOUGH THERE WAS NOW NOTHING TO WORK FOR MORE
696-93314-0046 HE WORKED AS HE HAD NEVER WORKED IN HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IF HE DID NOT TAKE TO WORK HE SHOULD TAKE TO DRINK OR WORSE DEVILS AND HE SET HIS TEETH AND SWORE THAT HER LOVER SHOULD NOT BE DEGRADED HE KNEW THAT SHE LOVED HIM AND THERE WAS A KIND OF FIERCE PAIN PLEASURE
696-93314-0047 LIKE THAT OF SCRATCHING A SORE IN THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS AS WRETCHED AS HE WAS THAT DIVIDED IN ALL ELSE THEY WERE YET UNITED IN THEIR SUFFERING HE THOUGHT IT MADE HIM MORE MISERABLE TO KNOW OF HER MISERY BUT IT DIDN'T HE NEVER SAW HER BUT HE DREAMED OF HER
696-93314-0048 AND SOMETIMES THE DREAMS GOT OUT OF HAND AND CARRIED HIM A THOUSAND WORLDS FROM ALL THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM THEN HE HAD TO WAKE UP AND THAT WAS BAD BUT THE ONLOOKER WAS NO DREAMER AND HE SAW HER ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK
696-93314-0049 COVERING A CLEAR CUT MASK OF SET ENDURANCE AND THERE WAS NO WORK THAT COULD SHUT OUT THAT SIGHT NO TEMPTATION OF THE WORLD THE FLESH OR THE DEVIL TO GIVE HIM EVEN THE RELIEF OF A FIGHT HE HAD NO TEMPTATIONS HE HAD NEVER HAD BUT THE ONE
696-93314-0050 HIS SOUL WAS NAKED TO THE BITTER WIND OF THE ACTUAL AND THE DAYS WENT BY WENT BY AND EVERY DAY HE KNEW MORE AND MORE SURELY THAT HE HAD LIED AND THROWN AWAY HIS SOUL AND THAT THE WAGES OF SIN WERE DEATH AND NO OTHER THING WHATEVER
696-93314-0051 AND GRADUALLY LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHOLE WORTH OF LIFE SEEMED TO LIE IN THE FAINT FAR CHANCE OF HIS BEING ABLE TO UNDO THE ONE TRIUMPHANTLY IMPULSIVE AND UNREASONING ACTION OF HIS LIFE
696-93314-0052 BUT THERE ARE SOME ACTS THAT THERE IS NO UNDOING AND THE HELL THAT HAD BURNED IN HIS HEART SO FIERCELY WHEN HE HAD SEEN HER IN THE OTHER MAN'S ARMS BURNED NOW WITH NEW BRIGHT LIGHTS AND INFERNAL FLICKERING FLAME TONGUES AND AT LAST OUT OF HELL
696-93314-0053 THE ONLOOKER REACHED OUT HIS HANDS AND CAUGHT AT PRAYER HE CAUGHT AT IT AS A DROWNING MAN CATCHES AT A WHITE GLEAM IN THE BLACK OF THE SURGING SEA ABOUT HIM IT MAY BE A PAINTED SPAR IT MAY BE EMPTY FOAM THE ONLOOKER PRAYED
696-93314-0054 YES SPEAKING PROFESSIONALLY I THINK YOU ARE WRONG YOU LESSEN YOUR CHANCES OF LIFE WHY DON'T YOU TRY A COMPLETE CHANGE BECAUSE IF YOU MUST KNOW MY CHANCES OF LIFE HAVE CEASED TO INTEREST ME
696-93314-0055 THE LOVER WAS SHORT WITH THE ONLOOKER BUT HE PERSISTED WELL IF ONE ISN'T INTERESTED IN ONE'S LIFE ONE MAY BE INTERESTED IN ONE'S DEATH OR THE MANNER OF IT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD ENLIST
696-93314-0056 IT'S BETTER TO DIE OF A BULLET IN SOUTH AFRICA THAN OF FRIGHT IN LONDON THAT ROUSED THE LOVER AS IT WAS MEANT TO DO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT BUSINESS IT IS OF YOURS SIR HE SAID
696-93314-0057 BUT IT'S YOUR BUSINESS TO KNOW THAT THEY WOULDN'T PASS A MAN WITH A HEART LIKE MINE I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE NOT SO PARTICULAR JUST NOW THEY WANT MEN I SHOULD TRY IT IF I WERE YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE CHANGE YOU'LL GO ALL TO PIECES
696-93314-0058 THAT'S ALL THE ONLOOKER GOT OUT AT THE NEXT STATION SHORT OF OWNING TO HIS OWN LIE HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD TO INSURE ITS BEING FOUND OUT FOR THE LIE IT WAS OR AT LEAST FOR A MISTAKE
696-93314-0059 AND WHEN HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD HE SAW THAT THE LOVER MIGHT NOT FIND IT OUT MIGHT BE PASSED FOR THE ARMY MIGHT GO TO THE FRONT MIGHT BE KILLED AND THEN WELL I'VE DONE MY BEST ANYHOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF
696-93314-0060 AND HIMSELF ANSWERED HIM LIAR YOU HAVE NOT DONE YOUR BEST YOU WILL HAVE TO EAT YOUR LIE YES THOUGH IT WILL SMASH YOUR LIFE AND RUIN YOU SOCIALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO TELL HIM YOU LIED AND TELL HIM WHY
696-93314-0061 YOU WILL NEVER LET HIM GO TO SOUTH AFRICA WITHOUT TELLING HIM THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT WELL YOU KNOW BEST I SUPPOSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT ARE YOU PERFECTLY CERTAIN
696-93314-0062 YE'LL MAK A FINE SOLDIER MY LAD I THINK NOT SAID THE LOVER AND HE WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE THIS TIME HE REELED LIKE A MAN TOO DRUNK TO CARE HOW DRUNK HE LOOKS HE DROVE IN CABS FROM HARLEY STREET TO WIMPOLE STREET
696-93314-0063 WHEN HE HAD TOLD THE GIRL EVERYTHING AND WHEN SHE WAS ABLE TO DO ANYTHING BUT LAUGH AND CRY AND CLING TO HIM WITH THIN HANDS SHE SAID DEAR I DO SO HATE TO THINK BADLY OF ANYONE BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT MAN WAS MISTAKEN
696-93314-0064 HE'S VERY VERY CLEVER MY CHILD
696-93314-0065 DON'T MEAN THAT I KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT THANK GOD OH THANK GOD I MEAN DON'T YOU THINK HE MAY HAVE LIED TO YOU TO PREVENT YOUR MARRYING ME
696-93314-0066 WHY SHOULD HE HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM THREE WEEKS AGO HE'S A VERY OLD FRIEND OF OURS I DO HATE TO BE SUSPICIOUS BUT IT IS ODD AND THEN HIS TRYING TO GET YOU TO SOUTH AFRICA
696-93314-0067 I'M CERTAIN HE WANTED YOU OUT OF THE WAY HE WANTED YOU TO GET KILLED OH HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO CRUEL
7059-77897-0000 OH NO I DON'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM SAID MISSUS MUNGER TOUCHING HER PONY WITH THE TIP OF HER WHIP LASH HE'S AN ODIOUS LITTLE CREATURE AND I KNEW THAT HE WOULD GO FOR THE DANCE AND SUPPER BECAUSE MISTER PECK WAS OPPOSED TO THEM HE'S ONE OF THE ANTI PECK PARTY IN HIS CHURCH
7059-77897-0001 AND THAT IS THE REASON I SPOKE TO HIM BUT I MEANT THE OTHER GENTLEMEN YOU SAW HOW THEY TOOK IT I SAW THAT THEY BOTH MADE FUN OF IT SAID ANNIE YES THAT'S JUST THE POINT
7059-77897-0002 IT THROWS A NEW LIGHT ON IT AND IF THAT'S THE WAY NICE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT IT WHY WE MUST GIVE UP THE IDEA I'M QUITE PREPARED TO DO SO BUT I WANT TO SEE MISSUS WILMINGTON FIRST MISSUS MUNGER SAID ANNIE UNEASILY
7059-77897-0003 I WOULD RATHER NOT SEE MISSUS WILMINGTON WITH YOU ON THIS SUBJECT I SHOULD BE OF NO USE
7059-77897-0004 AND SHE LAID HER ARM ACROSS ANNIE'S LAP AS IF TO PREVENT HER JUMPING OUT OF THE PHAETON AS MISSUS WILMINGTON'S OLD FRIEND YOU WILL HAVE THE GREATEST INFLUENCE WITH HER BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I WISH TO INFLUENCE HER IN FAVOUR OF THE SUPPER AND DANCE I DON'T KNOW THAT I BELIEVE IN THEM SAID ANNIE
7059-77897-0005 COWED AND TROUBLED BY THE AFFAIR THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE SAID MISSUS MUNGER IMPARTIALLY ALL YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IS TO KEEP STILL I WILL PUT THE CASE TO HER SHE CHECKED THE PONY BEFORE THE BAR WHICH THE FLAGMAN AT THE RAILROAD CROSSING HAD LET DOWN
7059-77897-0006 WHILE A LONG FREIGHT TRAIN CLATTERED DEAFENINGLY BY AND THEN DROVE BUMPING AND JOUNCING ACROSS THE TRACKS I SUPPOSE YOU REMEMBER WHAT OVER THE TRACK MEANS IN HATBORO OH YES SAID ANNIE WITH A SMILE SOCIAL PERDITION AT THE LEAST
7059-77897-0007 YES IT ISN'T SO BAD AS IT USED TO BE SOCIALLY MISTER WILMINGTON HAS BUILT A VERY FINE HOUSE ON THIS SIDE AND THERE ARE SEVERAL PRETTY QUEEN ANNE COTTAGES GOING UP THEY DROVE ALONG UNDER THE ELMS WHICH HERE STOOD SOMEWHAT AT RANDOM ABOUT THE WIDE GRASSLESS STREET
7059-77897-0008 BETWEEN THE HIGH WINDOWY BULKS OF THE SHOE SHOPS AND HAT SHOPS THE DUST GRADUALLY FREED ITSELF FROM THE CINDERS ABOUT THE TRACKS AND IT HARDENED INTO A HANDSOME NEWLY MADE ROAD BEYOND THE HOUSES OF THE SHOP HANDS
7059-77897-0009 THE LAWN BEFORE IT SLOPED DOWN TO THE ROAD WHERE IT ENDED SMOOTHLY AT THE BRINK OF A NEAT STONE WALL A BLACK ASPHALT PATH CURVED FROM THE STEPS BY WHICH YOU MOUNTED FROM THE STREET TO THE STEPS BY WHICH YOU MOUNTED TO THE HEAVY PORTICO
7059-77897-0010 BEFORE THE MASSIVE BLACK WALNUT DOORS THE LADIES WERE SHOWN INTO THE MUSIC ROOM FROM WHICH THE NOTES OF A PIANO WERE SOUNDING WHEN THEY RANG AND MISSUS WILMINGTON ROSE FROM THE INSTRUMENT TO MEET THEM A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN STANDING BESIDE HER TURNED AWAY
7059-77897-0011 MISSUS WILMINGTON WAS DRESSED IN A LIGHT MORNING DRESS WITH A WATTEAU FALL WHOSE DELICATE RUSSETS AND FADED REDS AND YELLOWS HEIGHTENED THE RICHNESS OF HER COMPLEXION AND HAIR WHY ANNIE SHE SAID HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU
7059-77897-0012 AND YOU TOO MISSUS MUNGER HOW VURRY NICE HER WORDS TOOK VALUE FROM THE THICK MELLOW TONES OF HER VOICE AND PASSED FOR MUCH MORE THAN THEY WERE WORTH INTRINSICALLY

7059-77897-0014 MISTER WILMINGTON AND MISSUS MUNGER ARE OLD FRIENDS THE YOUNG FELLOW BOWED SILENTLY AND ANNIE INSTANTLY TOOK A DISLIKE TO HIM HIS HEAVY JAW LONG EYES AND LOW FOREHEAD ALMOST HIDDEN UNDER A THICK BANG HE SAT DOWN CORNERWISE ON A CHAIR
7059-77897-0015 AND HAVING PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED MISSUS WILMINGTON IN FAVOUR OF THE GENERAL SCHEME ASKED HER WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF THAT PART MISTER JACK WILMINGTON ANSWERED FOR HER I SHOULD THINK YOU HAD A RIGHT TO DO WHAT YOU PLEASE ABOUT IT IT'S NONE OF THE HANDS BUSINESS IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO ASK THEM
7059-77897-0016 YES THAT'S WHAT ANY ONE WOULD THINK IN THE ABSTRACT SAID MISSUS MUNGER NOW LITTLE BOY

7059-77897-0020 AND THERE'S NO USE TRYING TO DENY IT AS MISTER PUTNEY SAYS HE AND I HAVE OUR RECORD AND WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE ANY PRETENCES AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER I OUGHT TO GO BACK ON MY FELLOW HANDS OH
7059-77897-0021 BUT MISSUS WILMINGTON SAID MISSUS MUNGER WITH INTENSE DEPRECATION THAT'S SUCH A VERY DIFFERENT THING YOU WERE NOT BROUGHT UP TO IT IT WAS JUST TEMPORARY AND BESIDES AND BESIDES

7059-77900-0000 MISS NORTHWICK CALLED UPON ANNIE DURING THE WEEK WITH EXCUSES FOR HER DELAY AND FOR COMING ALONE SHE SEEMED TO HAVE INTENTIONS OF BEING POLITE BUT SHE CONSTANTLY BETRAYED HER WANT OF INTEREST IN ANNIE AND DISAPPOINTED AN EXPECTATION OF REFINEMENT
7059-77900-0001 WHICH HER PHYSICAL DELICACY AWAKENED SHE ASKED HER HOW SHE EVER CAME TO TAKE UP THE SOCIAL UNION AND ANSWERED FOR HER THAT OF COURSE IT HAD THE ATTRACTION OF THE THEATRICALS AND WENT ON TO TALK OF HER SISTER'S PART IN THEM
7059-77900-0002 THE RELATION OF THE NORTHWICK FAMILY TO THE COMING ENTERTAINMENT AND AN IMPRESSION OF FRAIL MOTTLED WRISTS AND HIGH THIN CHEEKS AND AN ABSENCE OF MODELLING UNDER AFFLUENT DRAPERY WAS THE MAIN EFFECT OF MISS NORTHWICK'S VISIT WHEN ANNIE RETURNED IT
7059-77900-0003 SHE MET THE YOUNGER SISTER WHOM SHE FOUND A GREAT BEAUTY SHE SEEMED VERY COLD AND OF A HAUTEUR WHICH SHE SUBDUED WITH DIFFICULTY BUT SHE WAS MORE CONSECUTIVELY POLITE THAN HER SISTER AND ANNIE WATCHED WITH FASCINATION HER TURNS OF THE HEAD
7059-77900-0004 HER MOVEMENTS OF LEOPARD SWIFTNESS AND ELASTICITY THE CHANGING LIGHTS OF HER COMPLEXION THE CURVES OF HER FINE LIPS THE FLUTTERING OF HER THIN NOSTRILS A VERY NEW BASKET PHAETON STOOD GLITTERING AT ANNIE'S DOOR WHEN SHE GOT HOME

7059-77900-0014 THEY CAME ROUND INTO THE REGION OF THE SHOPS AND LYRA CHECKED HER PONY IN FRONT OF HER HUSBAND'S FACTORY IT WAS NOT IMPOSINGLY LARGE BUT AS MISSUS WILMINGTON CAUSED ANNIE TO OBSERVE IT WAS AS BIG AS THE HAT SHOPS AND AS UGLY AS THE SHOE SHOPS
7059-77900-0015 THE STRUCTURE TREMBLED WITH THE OPERATION OF ITS INDUSTRY AND AS THEY MOUNTED THE WOODEN STEPS TO THE OPEN OUTSIDE DOOR AN INNER DOOR SWUNG AJAR FOR A MOMENT AND LET OUT A ROAR MINGLED OF THE HUM AND WHIRL
7059-77900-0016 AND FINDING ITS FIRST APARTMENT EMPTY
7059-77900-0017 WHERE HER HUSBAND SAT WRITING AT A TABLE GEORGE I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MISS KILBURN
7059-77900-0018 WITH THE HABIT HE HAD OF TOUCHING IT THERE WITH THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE MADE ANNIE THINK OF A CAT THAT HAD BEEN AT THE CREAM I'VE BEEN HOPING TO CALL WITH MISSUS WILMINGTON TO PAY MY RESPECTS BUT I'VE BEEN AWAY A GREAT DEAL THIS SEASON AND AND

7059-77900-0021 I'LL GO WITH YOU WITH GREAT PLEASURE AH HE BUSTLED ABOUT PUTTING THE THINGS TOGETHER ON HIS TABLE AND THEN REACHING FOR THE PANAMA HAT ON A HOOK BEHIND IT THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN HIS EAGERNESS TO DO WHAT LYRA BADE HIM
7059-77900-0022 I'LL SHOW THEM THROUGH HE SAID TO HIS UNCLE AND THE OLD MAN ASSENTED WITH WELL PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER JACK AND WENT BACK TO HIS ROOM THE WILMINGTON STOCKING MILLS SPUN THEIR OWN THREADS
7059-77900-0023 AND THE FIRST ROOM WAS LIKE WHAT ANNIE HAD SEEN BEFORE IN COTTON FACTORIES WITH A FAINT SMELL OF OIL FROM THE MACHINERY AND A FINE SNOW OF FLUFF IN THE AIR AND CATCHING TO THE WHITE WASHED WALLS AND THE FOUL WINDOW SASHES
7059-77900-0024 THE TIRELESS MACHINES MARCHED BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE MEN WHO WATCHED THEM WITH SUICIDAL INTENSITY RAN AFTER THEM BAREFOOTED WHEN THEY MADE OFF WITH A BROKEN THREAD SPLICED IT AND THEN ESCAPED FROM THEM TO THEIR STATIONS AGAIN
7059-77900-0025 THEY LOOKED AFTER LYRA AND HER NEPHEW FROM UNDER COTTON FROWSED BANGS THEY ALL SEEMED TO KNOW HER AND RETURNED HER EASY KINDLY GREETINGS WITH AN EFFECT OF LIKING
7059-77900-0026 FROM TIME TO TIME AT LYRA'S BIDDING THE YOUNG FELLOW EXPLAINED TO ANNIE SOME CURIOUS FEATURE OF THE PROCESSES
7059-77900-0027 EXCEPT WHEN JACK WILMINGTON CURTLY ORDERED THEM TO DO THIS OR THAT IN ILLUSTRATION OF SOME POINT HE WAS EXPLAINING SHE WEARIED HERSELF AS PEOPLE DO IN SUCH PLACES IN EXPRESSING HER WONDER AT THE INGENUITY OF THE MACHINERY
7059-77900-0028 IT WAS A RELIEF TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL INTO THE ROOM COOL AND QUIET WHERE HALF A DOZEN NEAT GIRLS WERE COUNTING AND STAMPING THE STOCKINGS WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS HERE'S WHERE I USED TO WORK SAID LYRA
7059-77900-0029 AND HERE'S WHERE I FIRST MET MISTER WILMINGTON THE PLACE IS FULL OF ROMANTIC ASSOCIATIONS THE STOCKINGS ARE ALL ONE SIZE ANNIE
7059-77900-0030 I DON'T WELL THEY'RE NOT DREAMS EXACTLY ANNIE WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE FOR THEM WHEN THEY LEFT THE MILL SHE ASKED ANNIE TO COME HOME TO TEA WITH HER SAYING
7059-77900-0031 AS IF FROM A PERCEPTION OF HER DISLIKE FOR THE YOUNG FELLOW THAT JACK WAS GOING TO BOSTON THEY HAD A LONG EVENING TOGETHER AFTER MISTER WILMINGTON TOOK HIMSELF OFF AFTER TEA TO HIS STUDY AS HE CALLED IT
7059-77900-0032 AND REMAINED SHUT IN THERE ANNIE WAS UNEASILY AWARE OF HIM FROM TIME TO TIME BUT LYRA HAD APPARENTLY NO MORE DISTURBANCE FROM HIS ABSENCE THAN FROM HIS PRESENCE WHICH SHE HAD MANAGED WITH A FRANK ACCEPTANCE OF EVERYTHING IT SUGGESTED
7059-77900-0033 SHE TALKED FREELY OF HER MARRIAGE NOT AS IF IT WERE LIKE OTHERS BUT FOR WHAT IT WAS SHE SHOWED ANNIE OVER THE HOUSE AND SHE ENDED WITH A DISPLAY OF THE RICH DRESSES WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS BUYING HER AND WHICH SHE NEVER WORE BECAUSE SHE NEVER WENT ANYWHERE
7059-77900-0034 ANNIE SAID SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD AT LEAST LIKE TO GO TO THE SEASIDE SOMEWHERE DURING THE SUMMER BUT NO LYRA SAID IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE AND YOU KNOW ANNIE I ALWAYS DID HATE TROUBLE
7059-77900-0035 AND I DON'T WANT TO BE POKED INTO A HOTEL SO I STAY IN HATBORO SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A VILLAGE GIRL AND DID NOT MISS THE INTERESTS OF A LARGER LIFE AS SHE CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF THEM IN SOUTH HATBORO OR WANT THE BOTHER OF THEM
7059-77900-0036 SHE SAID SHE STUDIED MUSIC A LITTLE AND CONFESSED THAT SHE READ A GOOD DEAL NOVELS MOSTLY THOUGH THE LIBRARY WAS HANDSOMELY EQUIPPED WITH WELL BOUND GENERAL LITERATURE AT MOMENTS IT ALL SEEMED NO HARM
