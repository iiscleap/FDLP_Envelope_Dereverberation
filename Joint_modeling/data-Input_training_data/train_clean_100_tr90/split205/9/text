118-47824-0029 AND HE HAD ASKED FOR MONEY ONLY A TRIFLING SUM YET GRAHAM WOULD GRASP AT THE FACT TO SUPPORT HIS EARLIER SUSPICION PAREDES'S ARRIVAL POSSESSED ONE VIRTUE IT DIVERTED BOBBY'S THOUGHTS TEMPORARILY FROM HIS OWN DILEMMA FROM HIS INABILITY TO CHART A COURSE
118-47824-0030 GRAHAM ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ILL AT EASE
118-47824-0031 FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
118-47824-0032 WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
118-47824-0033 SIMPLE ENOUGH MISTER GRAHAM I TELEPHONED AS SOON AS RAWLINS GOT ME TO THE BASTILLE I COMMUNICATED WITH THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS THE COMPANY FOR WHICH I ONCE WORKED HE'S A PROMINENT AND BRILLIANT MAN HE PLANNED IT WITH SOME LOCAL FELLOW WHEN I WAS ARRAIGNED AT THE OPENING OF COURT THIS MORNING
118-47824-0034 THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
118-47824-0035 I DON'T MIND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OUT OF IT
118-47824-0036 YOUR PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE WAS THE LAST STRAW YOU WILL FORGIVE US CARLOS
118-47824-0037 HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
118-47824-0038 HIS EYES STILL SMILED BUT HIS VOICE WAS HARDER BYGONES ARE BYGONES ISN'T THAT SO BOBBY SINCE YOU WISH IT BOBBY SAID BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE KNOWLEDGE GRAHAM DESIRED LOOMED THE OLD QUESTION WHAT WAS THE MAN'S GAME WHAT HELD HIM HERE
118-47824-0039 ROBINSON ENTERED THE FLESH AROUND HIS EYES WAS PUFFIER THAN IT HAD BEEN YESTERDAY WORRY HAD INCREASED THE INCONGRUOUS DISCONTENT OF HIS ROUND FACE CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT LITTLE I SAW YOU ARRIVE HE SAID RAWLINS WARNED ME
118-47824-0040 BUT I MUST SAY I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D USE YOUR FREEDOM TO COME TO US
118-47824-0041 SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
118-47824-0042 THAT FLEETING SATANIC IMPRESSION OF YESTERDAY CAME BACK SHARPER MORE ALARMING PAREDES'S CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS STRENGTH HIS MIND WAS SUBTLER THAN THEIRS
118-47824-0043 HIS RESERVE AND EASY DARING MASTERED THEM ALL AND ALWAYS AS NOW HE LAUGHED AT THE FUTILITY OF THEIR EFFORTS TO SOUND HIS PURPOSES TO LIMIT HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION BOBBY DIDN'T CARE TO MEET THE UNCOMMUNICATIVE EYES WHOSE DEPTHS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE
118-47824-0044 THAT MIGHT MAKE MEN WALK UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS BRAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY APPEARED AS MUCH AT SEA AS THE OTHERS
118-47824-0045 AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
118-47824-0046 ROBINSON JERKED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS OUT THERE
118-47824-0047 NO HURRY BOBBY ANSWERED WITH A QUICK INTAKE OF BREATH I SUPPOSE NOT ROBINSON SNEERED SINCE EVERYBODY KNOWS WELL ENOUGH WHAT'S IN IT BOBBY AROSE ROBINSON STILL SNEERED YOU'LL BE AT THE GRAVE AS CHIEF MOURNER
118-47824-0048 BOBBY WALKED FROM THE ROOM HE HADN'T CARED TO REPLY HE FEARED AS IT WAS THAT HE HAD LET SLIP HIS INCREASED SELF DOUBT HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND HAT AND LEFT THE HOUSE THE RAW COLD THE YEAR'S FIRST OMEN OF WINTER MADE HIS BLOOD RUN QUICKER
118-47824-0049 FORCED INTO HIS MIND A CLEANSING STIMULATION BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EVEN THAT PROPHYLACTIC WAS DENIED HIM WITH HIS DIRECTION A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE CHANCE LED HIM INTO THE THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE
118-47824-0050 THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
118-47824-0051 FOR ONCE HE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE FOREST BECAUSE IT HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO GLANCE PERPETUALLY BACK AT THAT DISMAL AND PENSIVE PICTURE THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF TWIGS HASTILY LOPPED OFF OF BUSHES BENT AND TORN OF THE UNCOVERING THROUGH THESE CARELESS MEANS OF AN OLD PATH
118-47824-0052 THE DULL THUD OF EARTH FALLING REGULARLY HE PAUSED LISTENING THE LABOUR OF THE MEN WAS GIVEN AN UNCOUTH RHYTHM BY THEIR GRUNTING EXPULSIONS OF BREATH OTHERWISE THE NATURE OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM A SILENCE
118-47824-0053 IN ITSELF BEAST LIKE AND UNNATURAL AT LAST A HARSH VOICE CAME TO BOBBY ITS BREVITY POINTED THE PREVIOUS DUMBNESS OF THE SPEAKER DEEP ENOUGH AND BOBBY TURNED AND HURRIED BACK ALONG THE ROUGHLY RESTORED PATH
118-47824-0054 AS IF FLEEING FROM AN IMMATERIAL THING SUDDENLY QUICKENED WITH THE POWER OF ACCUSATION HE COULD PICTURE THE FRESH OBLONG EXCAVATION IN THE SOIL OF THE FAMILY BURIAL GROUND
118-47824-0055 THERE WAS AN IRONICAL JUSTICE IN THE CONDITION OF THE OLD CEMETERY IT HAD RECEIVED NO INTERMENT SINCE THE DEATH OF KATHERINE'S FATHER LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CEDARS SILAS BLACKBURN HAD DELIVERED IT TO THE SWIFT OBLITERATING FINGERS OF TIME
118-47824-0056 IF THE OLD MAN IN HIS SELFISHNESS HAD PAUSED TO GAZE BEYOND THE INEVITABLE FACT OF DEATH
118-47824-0057 HE WOULD HAVE GUARDED WITH A MORE PRECIOUS INTEREST THE DRAPINGS OF HIS FINAL SLEEP THIS NECESSARY TASK ON WHICH BOBBY HAD STUMBLED HAD MADE THE THICKET LESS CONGENIAL THAN THE HOUSE AS HE WALKED BACK HE FORECASTED WITH A KEEN APPREHENSION HIS APPROACHING ORDEAL
118-47824-0058 COULD HE WITNESS THE DEFINITE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS GRANDFATHER IN A NARROW BOX COULD HE WATCH THE COVERING EARTH FALL NOISILY IN THAT BLEAK PLACE OF SILENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING FOR ROBINSON
118-47824-0059 A STRANGE MAN APPEARED WALKING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE HIS BLACK CLOTHING RELIEVED ONLY BY NARROW EDGES OF WHITE CUFFS BETWEEN THE SLEEVES AND THE HEAVY MOURNING GLOVES FITTED WITH SOLEMN HARMONY INTO THE LANDSCAPE AND BOBBY'S MOOD
118-47824-0060 SUCH A FIGURE WAS APPROPRIATE TO THE CEDARS
118-47824-0061 HE EMERGED FROM THE FOREST AND SAW AGAIN THE LEISURELY WEAVING OF THE SMOKE SHROUD ABOVE THE HOUSE THEN HIS EYES WERE DRAWN BY THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF A PAIR OF HORSES
118-47824-0062 NO LIKELY PATH YET WHOSE CROSSING IS THE PRICE OF SALVATION HE WAS GLAD TO SEE GRAHAM LEAVE THE COURT AND HURRY TOWARD HIM I WAS COMING TO HUNT YOU UP BOBBY THE MINISTER'S ARRIVED SO HAS DOCTOR GROOM EVERYTHING'S ABOUT READY DOCTOR GROOM
118-47824-0063 IT'S NATURAL ENOUGH HE SHOULD BE HERE BOBBY AGREED INDIFFERENTLY THEY WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE GRAHAM MADE IT PLAIN THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR FROM THE SAD BUSINESS AHEAD
118-47824-0064 HE ASKED HE IGNORES WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY HE SETTLES HIMSELF IN THE CEDARS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT BOBBY ANSWERED THIS MORNING CARLOS GAVE ME THE CREEPS
118-47824-0065 HE SPOKE WITH PRONOUNCED DELIBERATION STARTLING BOBBY
118-47824-0066 GAVE ME THE CREEPS TOO MAKES ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE HAS AN ABOMINABLY DEEP PURPOSE IN USING HIS WITS TO HANG ON HERE HE SUGGESTS RESOURCES AS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AS ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE OLD ROOM YOU'LL CONFESS BOBBY HE'S HAD A GOOD DEAL OF INFLUENCE OVER YOU AN INFLUENCE FOR EVIL
118-47824-0067 I WON'T BLAME CARLOS FOR THAT BOBBY MUTTERED HE INFLUENCED YOU AGAINST YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT GRAHAM PERSISTED TO REFUSE TO LEAVE WITH ME THE NIGHT OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH MARIA DID HER SHARE BOBBY SAID HE BROKE OFF LOOKING AT GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
118-47824-0068 I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF SINCE HE CAME BACK GRAHAM ANSWERED IF THERE'S ANY QUEER POWER BEHIND HIS QUIET MANNER MAYBE HE IS PSYCHIC MAYBE HE CAN DO THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'VE WONDERED IF HE HAD WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING IT
118-47824-0069 ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE TO DIRECT YOUR BODY WHEN YOUR MIND NO LONGER CONTROLLED IT IT'S A NASTY THOUGHT BUT I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS YOU MEAN CARLOS MAY HAVE MADE ME GO TO THE HALL LAST NIGHT PERHAPS SENT ME TO THE OLD ROOM THOSE OTHER TIMES
118-47824-0070 NO I WON'T BELIEVE IT I'VE BEEN WEAK HARTLEY BUT NOT THAT WEAK AND I TELL YOU I DID FEEL HOWELLS'S BODY MOVE UNDER MY HAND DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME GRAHAM SAID GENTLY I MUST CONSIDER EVERY POSSIBILITY YOU WERE EXCITED AND IMAGINATIVE WHEN YOU WENT TO THE OLD ROOM TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE
118-47824-0071 MIGHT HAVE MOVED SPASMODICALLY I MEAN
118-47824-0072 AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EVIDENCE BOBBY DEFENDED HIMSELF IF IT HAD BEEN STOLEN EARLIER THE COAT POCKET MIGHT HAVE RETAINED ITS BULGING SHAPE
118-47824-0073 BUT I WAS THERE AND YOU WEREN'T
118-47824-0074 IF IT'S SO FAR FETCHED GRAHAM ASKED QUIETLY WHY DO YOU REVOLT FROM THE IDEA BOBBY TURNED ON HIM AND WHY DO YOU FILL MY MIND WITH SUCH THOUGHTS IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY SAY SO GO TELL ROBINSON SO
118-47824-0075 HE GLANCED AWAY WHILE THE ANGRY COLOUR LEFT HIS FACE HE WAS A LITTLE DAZED BY THE REALIZATION THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO GRAHAM AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO AN ENEMY AS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HOWELLS IN THE OLD BEDROOM HE FELT THE TOUCH OF GRAHAM'S HAND ON HIS SHOULDER I'M ONLY WORKING IN YOUR SERVICE GRAHAM SAID KINDLY
118-47824-0076 FOR GROOM HAS BROUGHT THE GHOSTS BACK WITH HIM DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT YOU WANT THE TRUTH DON'T YOU YES BOBBY SAID EVEN IF IT DOES FOR ME
118-47824-0077 YET THAT FLASH OF TEMPER HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO FACE THE ORDEAL A LINGERING RESENTMENT AT GRAHAM'S SUGGESTION LESSENED THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION ENTERING THE COURT HE SCARCELY GLANCED AT THE BLACK WAGON THERE WERE MORE DARK CLOTHED MEN IN THE HALL RAWLINS HAD RETURNED
118-47824-0078 THE PANAMANIAN HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHING HE TOO WAS SOMBRELY DRESSED AND INSTEAD OF THE VIVID NECKTIE HE HAD WORN FROM THE COURTHOUSE A JET BLACK SCARF WAS PERFECTLY ARRANGED BENEATH HIS COLLAR HE LOUNGED OPPOSITE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
118-47824-0079 HIS EYES STUDYING THE FIRE HIS FINGERS ON THE CHAIR ARM WERE RESTLESS DOCTOR GROOM STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TALKING WITH THE CLERGYMAN A STOUT AND UNCTUOUS FIGURE
118-47824-0080 FROM HIS THICKLY BEARDED FACE HIS REDDISH EYES GLEAMED FORTH WITH A FRESH INSTABILITY THE CLERGYMAN SHOOK HANDS WITH BOBBY WE NEED NOT DELAY YOUR COUSIN IS UPSTAIRS HE INCLUDED THE COMPANY IN HIS CIRCLING TURN OF THE HEAD ANY ONE WHO CARES TO GO
118-47824-0081 BOBBY FORCED HIMSELF TO WALK UP THE STAIRCASE FACING THE FIRST PHASE OF HIS ORDEAL HE SAW THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY REALIZED THAT TOO FOR HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND FOLLOWED BY RAWLINS STARTED UPWARD THE ENTIRE COMPANY CROWDED THE STAIRS
118-47824-0082 GRAHAM SUMMONED KATHERINE ONE OF THE BLACK CLOTHED MEN OPENED THE DOOR OF SILAS BLACKBURN'S ROOM HE STEPPED ASIDE BECKONING
118-47824-0083 BOBBY WENT IN WITH THE OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT HE CATALOGUED REMEMBERED OBJECTS ALL INTIMATE TO HIS GRANDFATHER EACH ODDLY ENTANGLED IN HIS MIND WITH HIS DISLIKE OF THE OLD MAN THE IRON BED THE CHEST OF DRAWERS
