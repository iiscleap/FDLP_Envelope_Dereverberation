7059-77900-0037 AT OTHERS THE LUXURY IN WHICH THIS LIFE WAS SO CONTENTEDLY SUNK OPPRESSED ANNIE LIKE A THICK CLOSE AIR YET SHE KNEW THAT LYRA WAS KIND TO MANY OF THE POOR PEOPLE ABOUT HER AND DID A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD AS THE PHRASE IS
7059-77900-0038 WITH THE SUPERFLUITY WHICH IT INVOLVED NO SELF DENIAL TO GIVE FROM BUT MISTER PECK HAD GIVEN HER A POINT OF VIEW AND THOUGH SHE BELIEVED SHE DID NOT AGREE WITH HIM SHE COULD NOT ESCAPE FROM IT
7059-77900-0039 OUGHT TO BE TACIT OR EXPLICIT IN THE KISSING AND EMBRACING BETWEEN ROMEO AND JULIET
7059-77900-0040 OH THEN SAID ANNIE PERHAPS HE ACCOUNTS FOR HER PLAYING JULIET
7059-77900-0041 OH IT'S AT THE REHEARSALS YOU KNOW THAT THE FUN IS
7059-77900-0042 ANNIE LAY AWAKE A LONG TIME THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SURE THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO LIKE LYRA IF SHE DID NOT APPROVE OF HER AND THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE GONE HOME TO TEA WITH HER AND SPENT THE EVENING WITH HER UNLESS SHE FULLY RESPECTED HER
7059-88364-0000 AROUND LOS ANGELES THE GREATEST AND MOST CHARACTERISTIC MOVING PICTURE COLONIES ARE BEING BUILT EACH PHOTOPLAY MAGAZINE HAS ITS CALIFORNIA LETTER TELLING OF THE PUTTING UP OF NEW STUDIOS AND THE TRANSFER OF ACTORS
7059-88364-0001 WITH MUCH SLAP YOU ON THE BACK PERSONAL GOSSIP THIS IS THE OUTGROWTH OF THE FACT THAT EVERY TYPE OF THE PHOTOPLAY BUT THE INTIMATE IS FOUNDED ON SOME PHASE OF THE OUT OF DOORS BEING THUS DEPENDENT
7059-88364-0002 THE PLANT CAN BEST BE SET UP WHERE THERE IS NO WINTER BESIDES THIS THE LOS ANGELES REGION HAS THE SEA THE MOUNTAINS THE DESERT AND MANY KINDS OF GROVE AND FIELD LANDSCAPE AND ARCHITECTURE ARE SUB TROPICAL
7059-88364-0003 BUT FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CALIFORNIA ASK ANY TRAVELLER OR STUDY THE BACKGROUND OF ALMOST ANY PHOTOPLAY IF THE PHOTOPLAY IS THE CONSISTENT UTTERANCE OF ITS SCENES IF THE ACTORS ARE INCARNATIONS OF THE LAND THEY WALK UPON
7059-88364-0004 AS THEY SHOULD BE CALIFORNIA INDEED STANDS A CHANCE TO ACHIEVE THROUGH THE FILMS AN UTTERANCE OF HER OWN WILL THIS LAND FURTHEST WEST BE THE FIRST TO CAPTURE THE INNER SPIRIT OF THIS NEWEST AND MOST CURIOUS OF THE ARTS
7059-88364-0005 ALREADY THE CALIFORNIA SORT IN THE COMMERCIAL CHANNELS HAS BECOME THE BROADLY ACCEPTED IF MEDIOCRE NATIONAL FORM PEOPLE WHO REVERE THE PILGRIM FATHERS OF SIXTEEN TWENTY
7059-88364-0006 HAVE OFTEN WISHED THOSE GENTLEMEN HAD MOORED THEIR BARK IN THE REGION OF LOS ANGELES RATHER THAN PLYMOUTH ROCK THAT BOSTON HAD BEEN FOUNDED THERE AT LAST THAT LANDING IS ACHIEVED
7059-88364-0007 PATRIOTIC ART STUDENTS HAVE DISCUSSED WITH MINGLED IRONY AND ADMIRATION THE BOSTON DOMINATION OF THE ONLY AMERICAN CULTURE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY NAMELY LITERATURE INDIANAPOLIS HAS HAD HER DAY SINCE THEN
7059-88364-0008 CHICAGO IS LIFTING HER HEAD NEVERTHELESS BOSTON STILL CONTROLS THE TEXT BOOK IN ENGLISH AND DOMINATES OUR HIGH SCHOOLS IRONIC FEELINGS IN THIS MATTER ON THE PART OF WESTERN MEN ARE BASED SOMEWHAT ON ENVY AND ILLEGITIMATE CUSSEDNESS
7059-88364-0009 BUT ARE ALSO GROUNDED IN THE HONEST HOPE OF A HEALTHFUL RIVALRY THEY WANT NEW ROMANTICISTS AND ARTISTS AS INDIGENOUS TO THEIR SOIL AS WAS HAWTHORNE TO WITCH HAUNTED SALEM OR LONGFELLOW TO THE CHESTNUTS OF HIS NATIVE HEATH
7059-88364-0010 WHATEVER MAY BE SAID OF THE PATRIARCHS FROM OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES TO AMOS BRONSON ALCOTT THEY WERE TRUE SONS OF THE NEW ENGLAND STONE FENCES AND MEETING HOUSES THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BORN OR NURTURED ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
7059-88364-0011 SOME OF US VIEW WITH A PECULIAR THRILL THE PROSPECT THAT LOS ANGELES MAY BECOME THE BOSTON OF THE PHOTOPLAY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SAY THE FLORENCE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA REMINDS ONE
7059-88364-0012 YET THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THE PRESENT DAY MAN IN THE STREET MAN ABOUT TOWN CALIFORNIAN HAS AN OBVIOUS MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIM THAT IS ALLIED TO THE EUCALYPTUS TREE THE POMEGRANATE CALIFORNIA IS A GILDED STATE
7059-88364-0013 IT HAS NOT THE SORDIDNESS OF GOLD AS HAS WALL STREET BUT IT IS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE NATURAL ORE THAT THE RAGGED PROSPECTOR FINDS THE GOLD OF CALIFORNIA IS THE COLOR OF THE ORANGE THE GLITTER OF DAWN IN THE YOSEMITE
7059-88364-0014 THE HUE OF THE GOLDEN GATE THAT OPENS THE SUNSET WAY TO MYSTIC AND TERRIBLE CATHAY AND HINDUSTAN THE ENEMY OF CALIFORNIA SAYS THE STATE IS MAGNIFICENT BUT THIN
7059-88364-0015 HE DECLARES IT IS AS THOUGH IT WERE PAINTED ON A BROBDINGNAGIAN PIECE OF GILT PAPER AND HE WHO DAMPENS HIS FINGER AND THRUSTS IT THROUGH FINDS AN ALKALI VALLEY ON THE OTHER SIDE THE LONELY PRICKLY PEAR AND A HEAP OF ASHES FROM A DESERTED CAMP FIRE
7059-88364-0016 HE SAYS THE CITIZENS OF THIS STATE LACK THE RICHNESS OF AN AESTHETIC AND RELIGIOUS TRADITION HE SAYS THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR TIME BUT EVEN THESE THINGS MAKE FOR COINCIDENCE
7059-88364-0017 AS THE SHADOW IT THROWS UPON THE SCREEN THIS NEWNESS CALIFORNIA HAS IN COMMON WITH ALL PHOTOPLAYS IT IS THRILLINGLY POSSIBLE FOR THE STATE AND THE ART TO ACQUIRE SPIRITUAL TRADITION AND DEPTH TOGETHER
7059-88364-0018 PART OF THE THINNESS OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT ONLY ITS YOUTH BUT THE RESULT OF THE PHYSICAL FACT THAT THE HUMAN RACE IS THERE SPREAD OVER SO MANY ACRES OF LAND THEY TRY NOT ONLY TO COUNT THEIR MINES AND ENUMERATE THEIR PALM TREES
7059-88364-0019 BUT THEY COUNT THE MILES OF THEIR SEA COAST AND THE ACRES UNDER CULTIVATION AND THE HEIGHT OF THE PEAKS AND REVEL IN LARGE STATISTICS AND THE BIGNESS GENERALLY AND FORGET HOW A FEW MEN RATTLE AROUND IN A GREAT DEAL OF SCENERY
7059-88364-0020 THEY SHOUT THEIR STATISTICS ACROSS THE ROCKIES AND THE DESERTS TO NEW YORK THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IS NON EXISTENT TO THE CALIFORNIAN HIS FELLOW FEELING IS FOR THE OPPOSITE COAST LINE
7059-88364-0021 THROUGH THE GEOGRAPHICAL ACCIDENT OF SEPARATION BY MOUNTAIN AND DESERT FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY HE BECOMES A MERE SHOUTER HURRAHING SO ASSIDUOUSLY THAT ALL VARIETY IN THE VOICE IS LOST
7059-88364-0022 THEY WILL BE A DIFFERENT SET OF VIRTUES FROM THOSE OF NEW ENGLAND THERE IS NO MORE NATURAL PLACE FOR THE SCATTERING OF CONFETTI THAN THIS STATE EXCEPT THE MOVING PICTURE SCENE ITSELF BOTH HAVE A GENIUS FOR GARDENS AND DANCING AND CARNIVAL
7059-88364-0023 WHEN THE CALIFORNIAN RELEGATES THE DRAMATIC TO SECONDARY SCENES BOTH IN HIS LIFE AND HIS PHOTOPLAY AND TURNS TO THE GENUINELY EPIC AND LYRIC
7059-88364-0024 HE AND THIS INSTRUMENT MAY FIND THEIR IMMORTALITY TOGETHER AS NEW ENGLAND FOUND ITS SOUL IN THE ESSAYS OF EMERSON
7059-88364-0025 THROUGH ALL FOUR SEASONS FAIRY BEAUTY OVERWHELMS THE LUMBERING GRAND STAND PLAYERS THE TINIEST GARDEN IS A JEWELLED PATHWAY OF WONDER BUT THE CALIFORNIAN CANNOT SHOUT
7059-88364-0026 ORANGE BLOSSOMS ORANGE BLOSSOMS HELIOTROPE HELIOTROPE HE CANNOT BOOM FORTH ROSELEAVES ROSELEAVES SO THAT HE DOES THEIR BEAUTIES JUSTICE
7059-88364-0027 HERE IS WHERE THE PHOTOPLAY CAN BEGIN TO GIVE HIM A MORE DELICATE UTTERANCE AND HE CAN GO ON INTO STRANGER THINGS AND EVOLVE ALL THE SPLENDOR FILMS INTO HIGHER TYPES FOR THE VERY NAME OF CALIFORNIA IS SPLENDOR
7059-88364-0028 THE CALIFORNIA PHOTO PLAYWRIGHT CAN BASE HIS CROWD PICTURE UPON THE CITY WORSHIPPING MOBS OF SAN FRANCISCO HE CAN DERIVE HIS PATRIOTIC AND RELIGIOUS SPLENDORS FROM SOMETHING OLDER AND MORE MAGNIFICENT
7059-88364-0029 THAN THE AISLES OF THE ROMANESQUE NAMELY THE GROVES OF THE GIANT REDWOODS THE CAMPAIGN FOR A BEAUTIFUL NATION COULD VERY WELL EMANATE FROM THE WEST COAST WHERE WITH THE SLIGHTEST CARE
7059-88364-0030 GROW UP MODELS FOR ALL THE WORLD OF PLANT ARRANGEMENT AND TREE LUXURY OUR MECHANICAL EAST IS REPROVED OUR TENSION IS RELAXED OUR UGLINESS IS CHALLENGED EVERY TIME WE LOOK UPON THOSE GARDEN PATHS AND FORESTS
7059-88364-0031 IT IS POSSIBLE FOR LOS ANGELES TO LAY HOLD OF THE MOTION PICTURE AS OUR NATIONAL TEXT BOOK IN ART AS BOSTON APPROPRIATED TO HERSELF THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE NATIONAL TEXT BOOKS OF LITERATURE
7059-88364-0032 IF CALIFORNIA HAS A SHINING SOUL AND NOT MERELY A GOLDEN BODY LET HER FORGET HER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MELODRAMATICS AND TURN TO HER POETS WHO UNDERSTAND THE HEART UNDERNEATH THE GLORY EDWIN MARKHAM
7059-88364-0033 THE DEAN OF AMERICAN SINGERS CLARK ASHTON SMITH THE YOUNG STAR TREADER GEORGE STERLING THAT SON OF ANCIENT MERLIN HAVE IN THEIR SONGS THE SEEDS OF BETTER SCENARIOS THAN CALIFORNIA HAS SENT US
7059-88364-0034 THERE ARE TWO POEMS BY GEORGE STERLING THAT I HAVE HAD IN MIND FOR MANY A DAY AS CONCEPTIONS THAT SHOULD INSPIRE MYSTIC FILMS AKIN TO THEM THESE POEMS ARE THE NIGHT SENTRIES AND
7067-76047-0000 AFTER TWENTY FOUR EVENTFUL HOURS OUR TWO STUDENTS OF HUMAN MOTIVES FOUND THEMSELVES TOGETHER AGAIN BY THE FIREPLACE IN THE OLD GEORGE SMOKING ROOM THEY HAD RESUMED THEIR OVERNIGHT CONVERSATION IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE TENSION
7067-76047-0001 A BROAD AND ORIGINAL THINKER AS YOU ARE THOUGHT IS ONE MATTER RASH INCONSIDERATE ACTION QUITE ANOTHER AND ABOVE ALL IF I SPEND ANOTHER DAY IN OR NEAR THE COMPANY OF MISS
7067-76047-0002 AND BIT HIS LOWER LIP AND CONSIDERED WE MIGHT DROP BELINDA HE SUGGESTED TURNING TO HIS FRIEND AND SPEAKING IN LOW CONFIDENTIAL TONES SHE IS QUITE A MANAGEABLE PERSON QUITE
7067-76047-0003 SHE COULD FOR EXAMPLE BE LEFT BEHIND WITH THE LUGGAGE AND SENT ON BY TRAIN I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU REALIZE HOW THE LAND LIES IN THAT QUARTER IT NEEDS ONLY A WORD TO MISS GRAMMONT THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE REPLY
7067-76047-0004 FOR A MOMENT HE HAD A WILD HOPE THAT HIS COMPANION WOULD AGREE AND THEN HE PERCEIVED THAT THE DOCTOR'S SILENCE MEANT ONLY THE PREPARATION OF AN ULTIMATUM I OBJECT TO MISS GRAMMONT AND THAT SIDE OF THE THING MORE THAN I DO TO MISS SEYFFERT
7067-76047-0005 SIR RICHMOND SAID NOTHING IT MAY HELP YOU TO SEE THIS AFFAIR FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE IF I TELL YOU THAT TWICE TODAY MISS SEYFFERT HAS ASKED ME IF YOU WERE A MARRIED MAN AND OF COURSE YOU TOLD HER I WAS
7067-76047-0006 ON THE SECOND OCCASION SIR RICHMOND SMILED AGAIN FRANKLY SAID THE DOCTOR THIS ADVENTURE IS ALTOGETHER UNCONGENIAL TO ME IT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED IN MY LIFE THIS HIGHWAY COUPLING
7067-76047-0007 DON'T YOU THINK SAID SIR RICHMOND THAT YOU ARE ATTACHING RATHER TOO MUCH WHAT SHALL I SAY ROMANTIC FLIRTATIOUS MEANING TO THIS AFFAIR
7067-76047-0008 BUT ISN'T YOUR ATTITUDE RATHER UNFAIR UNJUST INDEED AND ALMOST INSULTING TO THIS MISS GRAMMONT AFTER ALL SHE'S A YOUNG LADY OF VERY GOOD SOCIAL POSITION INDEED
7067-76047-0009 SHE DOESN'T STRIKE YOU DOES SHE AS AN UNDIGNIFIED OR HELPLESS HUMAN BEING HER MANNERS SUGGEST A PERSON OF CONSIDERABLE SELF CONTROL AND KNOWING LESS OF ME THAN YOU DO SHE PROBABLY REGARDS ME AS ALMOST AS SAFE AS A MAIDEN AUNT SAY
7067-76047-0010 I'M TWICE HER AGE WE ARE A PARTY OF FOUR THERE ARE CONVENTIONS THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS AREN'T YOU REALLY MY DEAR MARTINEAU OVERDOING ALL THIS SIDE OF THIS VERY PLEASANT LITTLE ENLARGEMENT OF OUR INTERESTS
7067-76047-0011 AM I SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND BROUGHT A SCRUTINIZING EYE TO BEAR ON SIR RICHMOND'S FACE I WANT TO GO ON TALKING TO MISS GRAMMONT FOR A DAY OR SO SIR RICHMOND ADMITTED THEN I SHALL PREFER TO LEAVE YOUR PARTY
7067-76047-0012 THERE WERE SOME MOMENTS OF SILENCE I AM REALLY VERY SORRY TO FIND MYSELF IN THIS DILEMMA SAID SIR RICHMOND WITH A NOTE OF GENUINE REGRET IN HIS VOICE IT IS NOT A DILEMMA SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU WITH A CORRESPONDING LOSS OF ASPERITY
7067-76047-0013 I GRANT YOU WE DISCOVER WE DIFFER UPON A QUESTION OF TASTE AND CONVENIENCE BUT BEFORE I SUGGESTED THIS TRIP I HAD INTENDED TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH MY OLD FRIEND SIR KENELM LATTER AT BOURNEMOUTH NOTHING SIMPLER THAN TO GO TO HIM NOW
7067-76047-0014 I SHALL BE SORRY ALL THE SAME I COULD HAVE WISHED SAID THE DOCTOR THAT THESE LADIES HAD HAPPENED A LITTLE LATER THE MATTER WAS SETTLED NOTHING MORE OF A PRACTICAL NATURE REMAINED TO BE SAID
7067-76047-0015 BUT NEITHER GENTLEMAN WISHED TO BREAK OFF WITH A HARSH AND BARE DECISION WHEN THE NEW AGE IS HERE SAID SIR RICHMOND THEN SURELY A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO THE THE INCONVENIENCES YOUR PRESENT CODE WOULD SET ABOUT IT
7067-76047-0016 AND HONOUR THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE IN MATTERS OF PROPERTY ECONOMICS AND PUBLIC CONDUCT IT WILL PROBABLY BE JUST THE REVERSE THEN THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE COLLECTIVE CONTROL AND MUCH MORE INSISTENCE LEGAL INSISTENCE UPON INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY
7067-76047-0017 BUT WE ARE NOT LIVING IN A NEW AGE YET WE ARE LIVING IN THE PATCHED UP RUINS OF A VERY OLD ONE AND YOU IF YOU WILL FORGIVE ME ARE LIVING IN THE PATCHED UP REMAINS OF A LIFE THAT HAD ALREADY HAD ITS COMPLICATIONS
7067-76047-0018 THIS YOUNG LADY WHOSE CHARM AND CLEVERNESS I ADMIT BEHAVES AS IF THE NEW AGE WERE ALREADY HERE WELL THAT MAY BE A VERY DANGEROUS MISTAKE BOTH FOR HER AND FOR YOU THIS AFFAIR IF IT GOES ON FOR A FEW DAYS MORE
7067-76047-0019 MAY INVOLVE VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES INDEED WITH WHICH I FOR ONE DO NOT WISH TO BE INVOLVED SIR RICHMOND UPON THE HEARTHRUG HAD A CURIOUS FEELING THAT HE WAS BACK IN THE HEAD MASTER'S STUDY AT CAXTON
7067-76047-0020 AND IN MANY WAYS INTERESTING I HAVE BEEN WATCHING HER I HAVE NOT BEEN FAVOURED WITH VERY MUCH OF HER ATTENTION BUT THAT FACT HAS ENABLED ME TO SEE HER IN PROFILE
7067-76047-0021 MISS SEYFFERT IS A FAIRLY CRUDE MIXTURE OF FRANKNESS INSINCERITY AND SELF EXPLANATORY EGOTISM AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISREGARD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF THE CONVERSATION SHE HAS ADDRESSED TO ME
7067-76047-0022 NOW I GUESS THIS MISS GRAMMONT HAS HAD NO MOTHER SINCE SHE WAS QUITE LITTLE YOUR GUESSES DOCTOR ARE APT TO BE PRETTY GOOD SAID SIR RICHMOND YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAS TOLD ME AS MUCH
7067-76047-0023 WELL SHE IMPRESSED ME AS HAVING THE AIR OF A GIRL WHO HAS HAD TO SOLVE MANY PROBLEMS FOR WHICH THE NORMAL MOTHER PROVIDES READY MADE SOLUTIONS THAT IS HOW I INFERRED THAT THERE WAS NO MOTHER I DON'T THINK THERE HAS BEEN ANY STEPMOTHER
7067-76047-0024 HER MANNER WITH MISS SEYFFERT AN EXCELLENT MANNER FOR MISS SEYFFERT BY THE BYE ISN'T THE SORT OF MANNER ANYONE ACQUIRES IN A DAY OR FOR ONE PERSON ONLY SHE IS A VERY SURE AND COMMANDING YOUNG WOMAN SIR RICHMOND NODDED
7067-76047-0025 I SUPPOSE HER FATHER ADORES AND NEGLECTS HER AND WHENEVER SHE HAS WANTED A COMPANION OR GOVERNESS BUTCHERED THE THING HAS BEEN DONE THESE BUSINESS AMERICANS I AM TOLD NEGLECT THEIR WOMENKIND GIVE THEM MONEY AND POWER LET THEM LOOSE ON THE WORLD
7067-76047-0026 IT IS A SORT OF MORAL LAZINESS MASQUERADING AS AFFECTION STILL I SUPPOSE CUSTOM AND TRADITION KEPT THIS GIRL IN HER PLACE AND SHE WAS PETTED HONOURED AMUSED
7067-76047-0027 TALKED ABOUT BUT NOT IN A HARMFUL WAY AND RATHER BORED RIGHT UP TO THE TIME WHEN AMERICA CAME INTO THE WAR THEORETICALLY SHE HAD A TREMENDOUSLY GOOD TIME I THINK THIS MUST BE NEAR THE TRUTH OF HER BIOGRAPHY SAID SIR RICHMOND
7067-76047-0028 I MEAN THAT SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY A RETINUE OF MEN WHO WANTED TO MARRY HER OR WHO BEHAVED AS THOUGH THEY WANTED TO MARRY HER OR WHO MADE HER HAPPINESS AND HER GRATIFICATIONS AND HER CONDESCENSIONS SEEM A MATTER OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THEM
7067-76047-0029 SHE HAD THE FLATTERY OF AN EXTREMELY UNCRITICAL AND UNEXACTING ADMIRATION THAT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT GRATIFIES A SILLY WOMAN EXTREMELY MISS GRAMMONT IS NOT SILLY
7067-76047-0030 PROBABLY BORED HER MORE THAN SHE REALIZED TO ANYONE TOO INTELLIGENT TO BE STEADILY EXCITED BY BUYING THINGS AND WEARING THINGS AND DANCING AND PLAYING GAMES AND GOING TO PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT AND BEING GIVEN FLOWERS SWEETS JEWELLERY
7067-76047-0031 AND THAT SHE HAD ALREADY READ AND THOUGHT RATHER MORE THAN MOST YOUNG WOMEN IN HER POSITION BEFORE SHE WAS TWENTY I GUESS SHE WAS ALREADY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING IN THE WAY OF MEN THAN A RICH ADMIRER WITH AN AUTOMOBILE FULL OF PRESENTS THOSE WHO SEEK FIND
7067-76047-0032 WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE FOUND WHAT WOULD A RICH GIRL FIND OUT THERE IN AMERICA I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T THE MATERIAL TO GUESS WITH IN LONDON A GIRL MIGHT FIND A CONSIDERABLE VARIETY OF ACTIVE INTERESTING MEN RISING POLITICIANS UNIVERSITY MEN OF DISTINCTION
7067-76047-0033 SHE WOULD FIND THAT LIFE WAS WORTH WHILE TO SUCH PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT MADE THE ORDINARY ENTERTAINMENTS AND AMUSEMENTS OF HER LIFE A MONSTROUS SILLY WASTE OF TIME WITH THE FACILITY OF HER SEX SHE WOULD PICK UP FROM ONE OF THEM THE IDEA THAT MADE LIFE WORTH WHILE FOR HIM
7067-76047-0034 HARSH EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND VERY PROFOUND MENTAL DISTURBANCE THERE HAVE BEEN LOVE EXPERIENCES EXPERIENCES THAT WERE SOMETHING MORE THAN THE TREATS AND ATTENTIONS AND PROPOSALS THAT MADE UP HER LIFE WHEN SHE WAS SHELTERED OVER THERE
7067-76047-0035 AND SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT WHAT IT IS I DON'T KNOW THE WAR HAS TURNED AN UGLY FACE TO HER SHE HAS SEEN DEATH AND SUFFERING AND RUIN PERHAPS SHE HAS SEEN PEOPLE SHE KNEW KILLED PERHAPS THE MAN HAS BEEN KILLED
7067-76047-0036 OR SHE HAS MET WITH COWARDICE OR CRUELTY OR TREACHERY WHERE SHE DIDN'T EXPECT IT SHE HAS BEEN SHOCKED OUT OF THE FIRST CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH SHE HAS CEASED TO TAKE THE WORLD FOR GRANTED IT HASN'T BROKEN HER BUT IT HAS MATURED HER
7067-76047-0037 THAT I THINK IS WHY HISTORY HAS BECOME REAL TO HER WHICH SO ATTRACTS YOU IN HER HISTORY FOR HER HAS CEASED TO BE A FABRIC OF PICTURESQUE INCIDENTS IT IS THE STUDY OF A TRAGIC STRUGGLE THAT STILL GOES ON
7067-76047-0038 SHE SEES HISTORY AS YOU SEE IT AND I SEE IT SHE IS A VERY GROWN UP YOUNG WOMAN IT'S JUST THAT SAID SIR RICHMOND IT'S JUST THAT IF YOU SEE AS MUCH IN MISS GRAMMONT AS ALL THAT WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO COME ON WITH US YOU SEE THE INTEREST OF HER
7067-76047-0039 I SEE A LOT MORE THAN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IT IS TO BE AS I AM RATHER COLD AND UNRESPONSIVE TO WOMEN AND UNATTRACTIVE AND NEGLIGIBLE NEGLIGIBLE THAT IS THE EXACT WORD TO THEM YOU CAN'T LOOK AT A WOMAN FOR FIVE MINUTES
7067-76047-0040 SEEMS TO IMPLY NECESSARILY A CERTAIN IMAGINATIVE FIXITY MISS GRAMMONT HAS AN IMPULSIVE AND ADVENTUROUS CHARACTER AND AS I HAVE BEEN SAYING SHE WAS A SPOILT CHILD WITH NO DISCIPLINE
7067-76047-0041 YOU ALSO ARE A PERSON OF HIGH INTELLIGENCE AND DEFECTIVE CONTROLS SHE IS VERY MUCH AT LOOSE ENDS YOU ON ACCOUNT OF THE ILLNESS OF THAT RATHER FORGOTTEN LADY MISS MARTIN LEEDS
7067-76047-0042 YOU I SAY ARE ALSO AT LOOSE ENDS CAN YOU DENY IT MY DEAR SIR DON'T WE BOTH KNOW THAT EVER SINCE WE LEFT LONDON YOU HAVE BEEN READY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ANY PRETTY THING IN PETTICOATS THAT SEEMED TO PROMISE YOU THREE HA'PORTH OF KINDNESS
7067-76047-0043 GROTESQUELY HAPPEN HE SAID SHE KNOWS NOTHING OF MARTIN LEEDS YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT AND THEN HE ADDED IF SHE AND YOU FALL IN LOVE
7067-76047-0044 AS THE PHRASE GOES WHAT IS TO FOLLOW THERE WAS A PAUSE SIR RICHMOND LOOKED AT HIS TOES FOR A MOMENT OR SO AS IF HE TOOK COUNSEL WITH THEM AND THEN DECIDED TO TAKE OFFENCE
7067-76047-0045 REALLY HE SAID THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS YOU TALK OF FALLING IN LOVE AS THOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MAN AND WOMAN TO BE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN EACH OTHER WITHOUT THAT AND THE GULF IN OUR AGES IN OUR QUALITY
7067-76047-0046 FROM THE PSYCHOLOGIST OF A NEW AGE I FIND THIS AMAZING ARE MEN AND WOMEN TO GO ON FOR EVER SEPARATED BY THIS POSSIBILITY INTO TWO HARDLY COMMUNICATING AND YET INTERPENETRATING WORLDS
7067-76047-0047 IS THERE NEVER TO BE FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANIONSHIP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WITHOUT PASSION YOU OUGHT TO KNOW EVEN BETTER THAN I DO THAT THERE IS NOT FOR SUCH PEOPLE AS YOU TWO ANYHOW
7067-76047-0048 AND AT PRESENT THE WORLD IS NOT PREPARED TO TOLERATE FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANIONSHIP WITH THAT ACCOMPANIMENT THAT IS THE CORE OF THIS SITUATION A PAUSE FELL BETWEEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN
7067-76047-0049 THEY HAD SMOOTHED OVER THE EXTREME HARSHNESS OF THEIR SEPARATION AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE MORE TO BE SAID WELL SAID SIR RICHMOND IN CONCLUSION I AM VERY SORRY INDEED MARTINEAU
7067-76048-0000 I LEAVE YOU TO IT HIS ROUND FACE BETRAYED LITTLE OR NO VESTIGES OF HIS OVERNIGHT IRRITATION OUGHT YOU TO LEAVE ME TO IT SMILED SIR RICHMOND I SHALL BE INTERESTED TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENS BUT IF YOU WON'T STAY TO SEE
7067-76048-0001 NOW SIR PLEASE SAID THE GUARD RESPECTFULLY BUT FIRMLY AND DOCTOR MARTINEAU GOT IN SIR RICHMOND WALKED THOUGHTFULLY DOWN THE PLATFORM TOWARDS THE EXIT WHAT ELSE COULD I DO HE ASKED ALOUD TO NOBODY IN PARTICULAR
7067-76048-0002 SECTION TWO FOR THE BETTER PART OF FORTY HOURS SIR RICHMOND HAD EITHER BEEN TALKING TO MISS GRAMMONT OR CARRYING ON IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH HER IN HER ABSENCE
7067-76048-0003 AND SHE REPEATED NO REMEMBERED COMMENTS AND PROPHETS OF HER CONTEMPORARIES ABOUT HERSELF SHE EITHER CONCEALED OR SHE HAD LOST ANY GREAT INTEREST IN HER OWN PERSONALITY
7067-76048-0004 BUT SHE WAS INTERESTED IN AND CURIOUS ABOUT THE PEOPLE SHE HAD MET IN LIFE AND HER TALK OF THEM REFLECTED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LIGHT UPON HER OWN UPBRINGING AND EXPERIENCES AND HER LIKING FOR SIR RICHMOND WAS PLEASINGLY MANIFEST
7067-76048-0005 SHE LIKED HIS TURN OF THOUGHT SHE WATCHED HIM WITH A FAINT SMILE ON HER LIPS AS HE SPOKE AND SHE SPREAD HER OPINIONS BEFORE HIM CAREFULLY IN THAT SOFT VOICE OF HERS LIKE A SHY CHILD SHOWING ITS TREASURES TO SOME SUDDENLY TRUSTED AND FAVOURED VISITOR
7067-76048-0006 AS A CRISIS IN WHICH THEY WERE CALLED UPON TO DO SOMETHING THEY DID NOT YET CLEARLY KNOW WHAT INTO THIS TOPIC THEY PEERED AS INTO SOME DEEP POOL SIDE BY SIDE AND IN IT THEY SAW EACH OTHER REFLECTED
7067-76048-0007 ITS DELIGHT WAS PARTICULARLY MANIFEST IN THE CREAM AND SALAD IT PRODUCED FOR LUNCH BOTH MISS GRAMMONT AND MISS SEYFFERT DISPLAYED AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN THEIR FOOD AFTER LUNCH THEY HAD ALL GONE OUT TO THE STONES AND THE WALL
