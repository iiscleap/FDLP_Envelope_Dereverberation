6019-3185-0107 HAD THESE VERY MURDERERS ADDED TO THEIR FUNCTIONS THOSE OF ROBBERY THEY WOULD HAVE BECOME LESS TERRIFIC
6019-3185-0108 FROM THE ROLL OF THOSE WHO WERE LIABLE TO A VISIT WHILE SUCH AS KNEW THEMSELVES LIABLE WOULD HAVE HAD WARNING OF THEIR DANGER IN THE FACT OF BEING RICH AND WOULD FROM THE VERY RICHES WHICH CONSTITUTED THAT DANGER HAVE DERIVED THE MEANS OF REPELLING IT BUT AS THINGS WERE
6019-3185-0109 NO MAN COULD GUESS WHAT IT WAS THAT MUST MAKE HIM OBNOXIOUS TO THE MURDERERS IMAGINATION EXHAUSTED ITSELF IN VAIN GUESSES AT THE CAUSES WHICH COULD BY POSSIBILITY HAVE MADE THE POOR WEISHAUPTS OBJECTS OF SUCH HATRED TO ANY MAN
6019-3185-0110 TRUE THEY WERE BIGOTED IN A DEGREE WHICH INDICATED FEEBLENESS OF INTELLECT BUT THAT WOUNDED NO MAN IN PARTICULAR WHILE TO MANY IT RECOMMENDED THEM TRUE THEIR CHARITY WAS NARROW AND EXCLUSIVE BUT TO THOSE OF THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS BODY IT EXPANDED MUNIFICENTLY
6019-3185-0111 AND BEING RICH BEYOND THEIR WANTS OR ANY MEANS OF EMPLOYING WEALTH WHICH THEIR GLOOMY ASCETICISM ALLOWED THEY HAD THE POWER OF DOING A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD AMONG THE INDIGENT PAPISTS OF THE SUBURBS
6064-300880-0000 FIVE TIMES MISTER THOMAS HARMON VAINLY RANG THE BELL OF THE REMSEN MANSION WHILE ENGAGED UPON THE SIXTH VARIATION HE BECAME AWARE OF A FACE IN THE WINDOW SCRUTINIZING HIM ALL RIGHT CALLED THE FACE

6064-300880-0027 FROM ITS WINDOW EMERGED A HEAVY PUFF OF SMOKE FROM ITS DOOR EMERGED MISTER THOMAS HARMON WHO ROLLED UPON THE PAVEMENT APPARENTLY STRANGLING MISTER MURPHY RUSHED TO HIS AID
6064-300880-0028 WHEN HE WAS RESTORED TO HIS FEET AND HIS BREATH AND THE TAXI HAD CEASED TO IMITATE FAFNIR THE DRAGON A TALL FIGURE IN AN EXTREMELY ENGLISH ULSTER WHICH HAD HASTILY EMERGED FROM THE REMSEN FRONT DOOR RUSHED DOWN TEN STEPS
6064-300880-0029 AND LEISURELY CLIMBED THEM AGAIN WAS WRENCHING VIOLENTLY AT THE BELL FOR A TIME MISTER MURPHY REGARDED HIM DISDAINFULLY THEN CROSSED OVER HELD BRIEF COLLOQUY AND RETURNED HOT CHANCE HE'S GOT OF BREAKING IN
6064-300880-0030 HE OBSERVED TO MISTER HARMON WHAT IS HE MAKING ALL THE FUSS ABOUT INQUIRED THAT GENTLEMAN AS THE VISITOR AGAIN APPLIED HIMSELF FORCEFULLY TO THE BELL WANTS TO SEE MISTER REMSEN
6064-300880-0031 BUT THE OLD BULLDOG OF A BUTLER WON'T LET HIM PUT HIS NOSE INSIDE THE DOOR SAYS HIS NAME IS CARTERET AND HE'S COME ALL THE WAY FROM ENGLAND TO SEE HIM ENGLAND NOT RODDY CARTERET
6064-300880-0032 IT WAS DONE ALMOST AS WELL AS THAT ACCOMPLISHED ACTOR MISTER JACOB REMSEN COULD HAVE DONE IT HARMON SPRANG ACROSS THE STREET
6064-300880-0033 HE CALLED WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING OVER HERE THE BELL RINGER ADJUSTED A MONOCLE AND AMBLED DOWN THE STEPS TO SHAKE HANDS
6064-300880-0034 PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT'S AMISS WITH THIS BEASTLY HOUSE I'LL TELL YOU PROFFERED THE OBLIGING AND INNOCENT MISTER MURPHY HE DID SO THEN I'LL JUST GO BACK AND JOLLY WELL CAMP THERE TILL SOMEBODY JOLLY WELL LETS ME IN
6064-300880-0035 DECIDED THE CALLER ARGUMENT FOLLOWED WHILE THE CHAUFFEUR BURROWED INTO THE MECHANISM OF HIS CAR IT ENDED BY THE ENGLISHMAN BESTOWING TWO DOLLARS UPON MISTER MURPHY TO GET A MESSAGE TO MISTER REMSEN CONTAINING A PROTEST AND AN ADDRESS
6064-300880-0036 THE TWO GENTLEMEN THEN MOVED AWAY IN THE EXTINGUISHED TAXI TICKETS HAD BEEN PROVIDED BY THE FORETHOUGHTFUL HARMON THE FUGITIVE WAS THE FIRST MAN IN THE PARLOR CAR
6064-300880-0037 AND WERE SHOWN INTO DRAWING ROOM A AT THE UPPER END OF THE CAR SHORTLY AFTER ANOTHER COUPLE ALSO GLISTENING AS TO GARB ENTERED AND TOOK POSSESSION OF DRAWING ROOM B AT THE LOWER END OF THE CAR
6064-300880-0038 THE ELUDER OF JUSTICE EYED THEM AND DREW HIS OWN CONCLUSIONS HERE WE ARE ALL OF US HE SAID TO HIMSELF RETIRING DISCREETLY BEHIND HIS NEWSPAPER
6064-56165-0000 HE WAS A HARVARD SOPHOMORE AND REALIZED HIS OWN IMPORTANCE QUITE AS MUCH AS THE GIRLS DID BUT STILL THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT HE WOULD COME INTO THE ROOM JUST FOR A MINUTE AND TELL THEM SOME OF THE LATEST CAMBRIDGE NEWS
6064-56165-0001 HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED TO CALL IT GOSSIP IF THERE WAS ANY ONE THING IN THE WORLD HE HATED SO HE SAID IT WAS GIRLS TALK THIS JABBERING ABOUT NOTHING FOR HIS PART HE WOULDN'T WASTE HIS TIME THAT WAY
6064-56165-0002 YET WHEN HE HAD AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE AND GIRLS GENERALLY APPRECIATED WHAT PHILIP SAID HE WOULD OFTEN SPEND AS MUCH AS HALF AN HOUR TALKING ABOUT THE FELLOWS
6064-56165-0003 AND HE WOULD GROW ALMOST ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN DESCRIBING THE TUSSLE BETWEEN NED BROWN AND STANLEY HOOPER OVER THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF BOSTON AND NEW YORK IN WHICH HOOPER THE NEW YORKER WAS TERRIBLY BEATEN AND UPON MY WORD HE CONCLUDED
6064-56165-0004 I WASN'T SORRY FOR THE NEW YORK SET IS GETTING JUST UNBEARABLE I WOULDN'T SO MUCH MIND FIGHTING STANLEY HOOPER MYSELF ABOUT NEW YORK AND BOSTON I GUESS I'D SHOW HIM THAT NEW YORK ISN'T THE WHOLE WORLD
6064-56165-0005 I SHOULD SAY NOT EXCLAIMED NORA BUT BELLE WHO HAD SOME NEW YORK COUSINS WAS SILENT BRENDA HOWEVER NOTICING BELLE'S EXPRESSION AND NOT FEELING DISPOSED TO SIDE COMPLETELY WITH NORA SAID
6064-56165-0006 YOU'RE TERRIBLY NARROW NORA TO THINK THAT NOBODY'S ANY GOOD UNLESS HE COMES FROM BOSTON I DIDN'T SAY SO REPLIED NORA NO BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN AND I'M SURPRISED PHILIP BLAIR
6064-56165-0007 WELL YOU'D BETTER TALK BRENDA BARLOW BROKE IN NORA AGAIN JUST SEE THE WAY YOU TREAT JULIA IF SHE'D BEEN BORN IN BOSTON I DON'T TREAT HER INTERRUPTED BRENDA
6064-56165-0008 NO THAT'S JUST IT YOU DON'T TREAT HER DECENTLY
6064-56165-0009 HOW QUEER GIRLS ARE DO YOU ALWAYS FIGHT LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE TOGETHER WE DON'T FIGHT LIKE YOU BOYS ANSWERED EDITH GOOD HUMOREDLY WE DON'T KNOCK EACH OTHER DOWN AND RUN THE RISK OF BREAKING ONE ANOTHER'S NOSES
6064-56165-0010 PHILIP LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER IN THE GLASS THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH HIS OWN SHAPELY NOSE AND I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HAVE RUN ANY SUCH RISK AS EDITH SUGGESTED PERHAPS THIS WAS THE REASON WHY PHILIP WAS NOT A FIGHTER
6064-56165-0011 THERE WAS ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THE LITTLE DISPUTES IN WHICH BRENDA AND BELLE INDULGED THEY VERY SELDOM LASTED LONG IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THE GIRLS WERE ASHAMED OF HAVING SHOWN TEMPER BEFORE PHILIP
6064-56165-0012 OH SAY DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE TIME WILL HARDON HAD WITH THE DICKY LAST WEEK HE ASKED NORA NODDED SHE TOO HAD A BROTHER IN COLLEGE WHAT WAS IT ASKED EDITH YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME PHILIP
6064-56165-0013 HOW FUNNY YOU ARE EDITH SAID BELLE YOU NEVER HEAR ANYTHING HASN'T ANYONE TOLD YOU HOW THE OTHER FELLOWS MADE HIM RUN BLINDFOLDED IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES DOWN BEACON STREET NO REALLY
6064-56165-0014 AND EVERYBODY LOOKING AT HIM OH SAID ONE GIRL AND AH SAID ANOTHER AND HOW SILLY THEY ALL CRIED TOGETHER IF GIRLS AMUSED THEMSELVES LIKE THAT WHAT FUN YOU'D MAKE OF US SAID THE PRACTICAL NORA
6064-56165-0015 OH IT GIVES A FELLOW A CHANCE TO SHOW WHAT KIND OF STUFF HE'S MADE OF EXPLAINED PHILIP WHETHER HE HAS GOOD MANNERS AND WHETHER HE'S CLEVER AND ALL THAT THERE MUST BE BETTER WAYS OF SHOWING BRAVERY
6064-56165-0016 SAID THE PRACTICAL EDITH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT WILL HARDON'S BRAVERY THAN YOU DID BEFORE WE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT HIS MANNERS WHAT WHY WHEN HE SAW WHERE HE WAS HE DIDN'T RUN AWAY OR FLUNK OUT
6064-56165-0017 HE ONLY LOOKED A LITTLE SHEEPISH THE OTHER FELLOWS SAID
6064-56165-0018 HE WALKED OFF AS NICE AS YOU PLEASE WASN'T HE MAD AT THE TWO FELLOWS FOR TAKING HIM THERE OF COURSE NOT THAT'S A PART OF THE THING WHY THERE ARE FELLOWS IN CAMBRIDGE WHO WOULD GO THROUGH FIRE AND WATER
6064-56165-0019 OR STAND ON THEIR HEADS IN FRONT OF A PULPIT FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING INTO THE DICKY I TELL YOU WE MAKE SOME OF THEM SUFFER
6064-56165-0020 ALTHOUGH HE HAD BELONGED TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS ORGANIZATION A VERY SHORT TIME WELL I THINK YOU'RE PERFECTLY HORRID CRIED BRENDA I MEAN THE DICKY I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE WAY YOU MAKE PEOPLE SUFFER BRANDING THEM WITH HOT CIGARS AND MAKING THEM RUN BAREFOOT WINTER NIGHTS AND
6064-56165-0021 THERE ARE A LOT OF GIRLS STUDYING IN CAMBRIDGE NOW AT THE ANNEX AND THE FELLOWS DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL WELL I DECLARE EXCLAIMED NORA I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKES TO THEM
6064-56165-0022 OH THEY HATE TO SEE THESE GIRLS GOING ABOUT WITH BOOKS AND TRYING TO GET INTO HARVARD YES TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE WALLS SAID NORA SARCASTICALLY
6064-56165-0023 OH SEE HERE IT WOULD JUST SPOIL EVERYTHING TO HAVE WOMEN IN THE CLASSES WITH US ARE YOU AFRAID THEY'D GET AHEAD OF YOU ASKED EDITH GENTLY NOW LOOK HERE EDITH
6064-56165-0024 INTERRUPTED PHILIP I'VE HEARD THAT SOME PROFESSORS SAY THAT THEIR ANNEX CLASSES DO BETTER WORK THAN OURS BUT ANYBODY CAN TELL THAT THAT'S ALL ROT I BELIEVE IT'S ALL PERFECTLY TRUE SAID NORA
6064-56165-0025 WELL I WISH MYSELF THAT OUR ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR HADN'T SUCH A FONDNESS FOR READING THEMES TO US THAT THE GIRLS HAVE WRITTEN HE MAKES OUT THAT THEY ARE BETTER THAN OURS BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT I SEE IT MYSELF WHO GETS THE BEST MARKS
6064-56165-0026 DOES JULIA WEAR GLASSES OR LOOK GREEN I BEG YOUR PARDON BRENDA NO SHE DOESN'T SAID NORA SHORTLY SHE'S ABOUT THE NICEST GIRL I KNOW OH SHE IS LOVELY ADDED EDITH
6064-56165-0027 A MATTER OF OPINION MURMURED BELLE UNDER HER BREATH YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER CRIED BRENDA IN SURPRISE NO I HAVEN'T HAPPENED TO ANSWERED PHILIP
6064-56165-0028 SHE'S INVITED TO MY COOKING PARTY NEXT WEEK SAID NORA YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED TOO SO YOU'LL SEE HER OH YES BY THE WAY SAID PHILIP WHAT EVENING IS IT FRIDAY OF COURSE REPLIED NORA
6064-56165-0029 SO WE CAN SIT UP LATE WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY WELL YOU'LL SEE ME SURE SAID PHILIP BUT SEE HERE IT'S FIVE O'CLOCK NOW AND I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT DOWN TOWN
6064-56165-0030 PHILIP HURRIED OFF BOWING IN A VERY GROWN UP WAY TO THE GROUP OF GIRLS FOR WHATEVER CRITICISMS ANY ONE MIGHT MAKE ABOUT PHILIP'S INDOLENCE AND DISINCLINATION TO STUDY NO ONE COULD DENY THAT HE HAD VERY GOOD MANNERS
6064-56165-0031 THOUGH ONLY ABOUT FOUR YEARS THEIR SENIOR HE SEEMED MUCH OLDER THAN BRENDA AND HER FRIENDS YEARS BEFORE THEY HAD ALL BEEN PLAYMATES TOGETHER BUT HIS TWO YEARS IN COLLEGE HAD TAKEN HIM AWAY FROM THEM
6064-56165-0032 AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HE CONDESCENDED TO SPEND AS LONG A TIME IN THEIR PRESENCE AS HAD BEEN THE CASE THIS AFTERNOON DO YOU THINK THAT PHILIP LOOKS VERY WELL EDITH
6064-56165-0033 REPLIED PHILIP'S SISTER IT SEEMED TO ME HE WAS JUST A LITTLE PALE HE IS ALWAYS PALE SAID EDITH DO YOU SUPPOSE HE SITS UP TOO LATE ASKED BRENDA I'LL WARRANT HE DOESN'T STUDY TOO MUCH SAID BELLE
6064-56165-0034 HOW CAN YOU CRITICISE EDITH'S BROTHER DON'T LET HER DO IT EDITH IT DOESN'T TROUBLE ME ANSWERED THE PLACID EDITH I KNOW ALL ABOUT PHILIP AND HE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME THAT'S RIGHT SAID NORA
6064-56165-0035 HE SAYS THERE ARE TWO OR THREE FELLOWS JUST SPONGING OFF OF PHILIP ALL THE TIME AND PHILIP IS TOO GOOD NATURED TO SAY ANYTHING I WONDER HOW HE'LL LIKE JULIA SAID EDITH
6064-56165-0036 HASTILY INTERPOSED BELLE BOYS NEVER LIKE A GIRL WHO STUDIES ESPECIALLY ONE WHO IS GOING TO COLLEGE WELL JULIA IS JUST THE NICEST GIRL I KNOW SAID NORA REPEATING THE WORDS SHE HAD USED TO PHILIP
6064-56168-0000 FOR A WEEK BEFORE THANKSGIVING THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AMONG THE SCHOOLGIRLS ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPROACHING FOOTBALL GAME THE FOUR WERE AS EXCITED AS THE OTHERS ALTHOUGH NOT SO MANY OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR FRIENDS WERE IN THE HARVARD TEAM
6064-56168-0001 IT WAS TO BE A GAME WITH PRINCETON ONE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY MATCHES AND FOR SPECIAL REASONS THERE WAS THE DEEPEST INTEREST IN THE MATCH THOSE GIRLS WHO HAD BROTHERS IN COLLEGE OR EVEN COUSINS OR FRIENDS HELD THEMSELVES WITH MORE DIGNITY THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS
6064-56168-0002 AND THOSE WHO HAD RELATIVES IN THE TEAM WERE TOO PROUD FOR ANYTHING AS BRENDA SAID THE GAME WAS TO BE PLAYED IN HOLMES FIELD AND TICKETS WERE NOT EASY TO GET BECAUSE THE SEATS WERE FAR LESS NUMEROUS THAN NOW ON THE GREAT SOLDIERS FIELD
6064-56168-0003 THE GIRLS WERE MAKING UP LITTLE GROUPS TO GO TO THE GAME WITH YOUTHS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AS ESCORTS UNDER THE CHAPERONAGE OF OLDER PEOPLE A FEW WHO HAD RECEIVED NO INVITATION WERE ESPECIALLY MISERABLE AND TOOK NO TROUBLE TO DISGUISE THEIR FEELINGS
6064-56168-0004 WHO HAD NOT BEEN INVITED ELSEWHERE TO GO IN SOME OTHER PARTY NOW EDITH WAS OF A GENERALLY GENEROUS DISPOSITION AND NOT INCLINED TO LIMIT HER FAVORS OF WHATEVER NATURE TO ANY PARTICULAR SET OF GIRLS
6064-56168-0005 AND EVEN OCCASIONALLY FROM BRENDA BOTH OF WHOM WERE INCLINED TO BE MORE EXCLUSIVE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THE GENERAL HARMONY OF THE FOUR WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED WHEN NORA ONE DAY AT RECESS EXCLAIMED WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE IS GOING WITH US TO THE GAME
6064-56168-0006 FOR OF COURSE IN THE MINDS OF THE OTHERS THERE COULD BE BUT ONE GAME
6064-56168-0007 WHY WHO IS IT CRIED BRENDA AND WHO IS IT ECHOED BELLE I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T GUESS OH DON'T BE SILLY NORA IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH WHILE TO GUESS ABOUT SOMETHING YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT SO SOON
6064-56168-0008 EXCEPT THAT YOU SPEAK AS IF IT WERE SOME ONE WE MIGHT NOT CARE TO HAVE AND IF THAT'S THE CASE I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD SAID BELLE IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE THAT BROKE IN BRENDA RATHER SNAPPISHLY I WILL JUST TELL EDITH WHAT I THINK
6064-56168-0009 IT THAT CRIED NORA DIDN'T I SAY THAT IT WAS A PERSON A GIRL IF I MUST BE MORE DEFINITE RUTH ROBERTS IF I MUST TELL JUST WHO IT IS OH CRIED BELLE AND AH ECHOED BRENDA
6064-56168-0010 YOU NEED NOT LOOK SO SURPRISED REJOINED NORA AND IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WILL NOT SAY ANYTHING TO EDITH SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HER OWN WAY IN ARRANGING HER OWN PARTY AND YOU KNOW WHEN SHE MAKES UP HER MIND IT IS OF NO USE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT
6064-56168-0011 IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO HAVE JULIA TAGGING ABOUT EVERYWHERE BUT WHY IN THE WORLD WE SHOULD HAVE RUTH ROBERTS WHEN WE NEVER SEE HER ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT SCHOOL I REALLY CANNOT UNDERSTAND AND I DON'T SEE HOW YOU AND NORA CAN LIKE IT EITHER WHY
6064-56168-0012 RUTH ROBERTS IS AS PLEASANT A GIRL AS THERE IS IN SCHOOL AND YET SHE WOULD HAVE A TERRIBLY LONELY TIME IF IT WERE NOT FOR EDITH AND JULIA NOBODY ELSE EVER THINKS OF SPEAKING TO HER WELL WHY SHOULD WE
6064-56168-0013 YES THAT'S WHAT I THINK TOO NORA SMILED PLEASANTLY AND HER EYES LOOKED BRIGHTER THAN EVER UNDER THE RIM OF HER BROWN FELT HAT WITH ITS TRIMMINGS OF LIGHTER BROWN NORA'S TEMPER WAS NOT EASILY RUFFLED
6064-56168-0014 THEN BELLE ADDED A FINAL WORD OH IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS IS ALL JULIA'S DOINGS
6064-56168-0015 BUT I DON'T SEE TURNING RATHER SNAPPISHLY TOWARDS BRENDA WHY THE REST OF US HAVE GOT TO TAKE UP RUTH ROBERTS JUST BECAUSE YOUR COUSIN JULIA IS SO DEVOTED TO HER NOW THIS WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH EVEN FOR BRENDA
6064-56168-0016 AND ANYWAY I'M THANKFUL TO HAVE JULIA TAKE A FANCY TO ANYBODY IT LEAVES US A GREAT DEAL FREER TO DO AS WE LIKE I SHOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD SEE THAT YOURSELF OH WELL SAID NORA LAUGHING THE WHOLE THING IS NOT WORTH QUARRELING ABOUT
6064-56168-0017 YES I KNOW BUT STILL THE LEAST SAID THE SOONEST MENDED SAID NORA THOUGH TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH THE QUOTATION DID NOT SOUND ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE THE LEAST SAID THE SOONEST MENDED
6064-56168-0018 I AM GOING TO CARRY AN ORANGE SCARF AND PERHAPS AN ORANGE FLAG WHAT FOR WHY I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING EXCLAIMED NORA NOR I CRIED BRENDA AT A HARVARD GAME
