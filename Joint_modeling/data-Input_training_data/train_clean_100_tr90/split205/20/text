1578-140049-0022 ON IT STOOD THE SACRED THE ADORED THE LONG DESIRED OBJECT ALMOST AS BEAUTIFUL AND NEARLY HALF AS LARGE AS THE ADVERTISEMENT THE BRASS GLISTENED LIKE GOLD AND THE CRIMSON PAPER SHADE GLOWED LIKE A GIANT RUBY
1578-140049-0023 IN THE WIDE SPLASH OF LIGHT THAT IT FLUNG UPON THE FLOOR SAT THE SIMPSONS IN REVERENT AND SOLEMN SILENCE EMMA JANE STANDING BEHIND THEM HAND IN HAND WITH REBECCA THERE SEEMED TO BE NO DESIRE FOR CONVERSATION THE OCCASION WAS TOO THRILLING AND SERIOUS FOR THAT
1578-140049-0024 THE LAMP IT WAS TACITLY FELT BY EVERYBODY WAS DIGNIFYING THE PARTY AND PROVIDING SUFFICIENT ENTERTAINMENT SIMPLY BY ITS PRESENCE BEING FULLY AS SATISFACTORY IN ITS WAY AS A PIANOLA OR A STRING BAND I WISH FATHER COULD SEE IT SAID CLARA BELLE LOYALLY
1578-140049-0025 MURMURED SUSAN SAGACIOUSLY AT THE APPOINTED HOUR REBECCA DRAGGED HERSELF RELUCTANTLY AWAY FROM THE ENCHANTING SCENE
1578-140049-0026 AND OH I'M SO GLAD YOU BOTH LIVE WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT SHINE FROM OUR WINDOWS I WONDER HOW LONG IT WILL BURN WITHOUT BEIN FILLED IF I ONLY KEEP IT LIT ONE HOUR EVERY NIGHT
1578-140049-0027 MISTER TUBBS BROUGHT IT OVER FROM NORTH RIVERBORO AND SAID SOMEBODY SENT AN ORDER BY MAIL FOR IT REBECCA SQUEEZED EMMA JANE'S ARM AND EMMA JANE GAVE A RAPTUROUS RETURN SQUEEZE
1578-140049-0028 IT WAS MISTER ALADDIN WHISPERED REBECCA AS THEY RAN DOWN THE PATH TO THE GATE SEESAW FOLLOWED THEM AND HANDSOMELY OFFERED TO SEE THEM APIECE DOWN THE ROAD BUT REBECCA DECLINED HIS ESCORT WITH SUCH DECISION THAT HE DID NOT PRESS THE MATTER
1578-140049-0029 BUT WENT TO BED TO DREAM OF HER INSTEAD IN HIS DREAMS FLASHES OF LIGHTNING PROCEEDED FROM BOTH HER EYES AND SHE HELD A FLAMING SWORD IN EITHER HAND REBECCA ENTERED THE HOME DINING ROOM JOYOUSLY THE BURNHAM SISTERS HAD GONE AND THE TWO AUNTS WERE KNITTING
1578-140049-0030 IT WAS A HEAVENLY PARTY SHE CRIED TAKING OFF HER HAT AND CAPE GO BACK AND SEE IF YOU HAVE SHUT THE DOOR TIGHT AND THEN LOCK IT SAID MISS MIRANDA IN HER USUAL AUSTERE MANNER
1578-140049-0031 AND OH AUNT JANE AUNT MIRANDA IF YOU'LL ONLY COME INTO THE KITCHEN AND LOOK OUT OF THE SINK WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE BANQUET LAMP SHINING ALL RED JUST AS IF THE SIMPSONS HOUSE WAS ON FIRE AND PROBABLY IT WILL BE BEFORE LONG OBSERVED MIRANDA I'VE GOT NO PATIENCE WITH SUCH FOOLISH GOIN'S ON
1578-140049-0032 JANE ACCOMPANIED REBECCA INTO THE KITCHEN ALTHOUGH THE FEEBLE GLIMMER WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE FROM THAT DISTANCE DID NOT SEEM TO HER A DAZZLING EXHIBITION SHE TRIED TO BE AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS POSSIBLE REBECCA WHO WAS IT
1578-140049-0033 THAT SOLD THE THREE HUNDRED CAKES OF SOAP TO MISTER LADD IN NORTH RIVERBORO MISTER WHO EXCLAIMED REBECCA MISTER LADD IN NORTH RIVERBORO IS THAT HIS REAL NAME QUERIED REBECCA IN ASTONISHMENT I DIDN'T MAKE A BAD GUESS AND SHE LAUGHED SOFTLY TO HERSELF

1578-140049-0036 THERE CAN'T BE ANYTHING WRONG THIS TIME REBECCA ANSWERED CONFIDENTLY EMMA JANE SOLD HER CAKES TO HER OWN RELATIONS AND TO UNCLE JERRY COBB AND I WENT FIRST TO THOSE NEW TENEMENTS NEAR THE LUMBER MILL AND THEN TO THE LADDS MISTER LADD BOUGHT ALL WE HAD AND MADE US PROMISE TO KEEP THE SECRET UNTIL THE PREMIUM CAME
1578-140049-0037 REBECCA'S HAIR WAS LOOSENED AND FALLING OVER HER FOREHEAD IN RUFFLED WAVES HER EYES WERE BRILLIANT HER CHEEKS CRIMSON THERE WAS A HINT OF EVERYTHING IN THE GIRL'S FACE OF SENSITIVENESS AND DELICACY AS WELL AS OF ARDOR
1578-140049-0038 THERE WAS THE SWEETNESS OF THE MAYFLOWER AND THE STRENGTH OF THE YOUNG OAK BUT ONE COULD EASILY DIVINE THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THE SOULS BY NATURE PITCHED TOO HIGH BY SUFFERING PLUNGED TOO LOW
1578-6379-0000 THE THIRD MAN FROM THE END OH PATTY DID YOU BRING US SOME WEDDING CAKE DID YOU HAVE ANY ADVENTURES
1578-6379-0001 WITH THE DEXTERITY OF PRACTICE SPRANG UPON THE REAR STEP OF THE HEARSE AS IT TURNED IN AT THE SCHOOL GATE AND ROLLED UP THE CURVING DRIVE TO THE PORTE COCHERE THE HEARSE WAS THE POPULAR NAME FOR THE BLACK VARNISHED WAGONETTE WHICH CONVEYED THE PUPILS OF SAINT URSULA'S FROM CHURCH AND STATION
1578-6379-0002 IT WAS PLANNED TO ACCOMMODATE TWENTY PATTY AND HER SUIT CASE ALONE IN THE CAPACIOUS INTERIOR WERE JOLTING ABOUT LIKE TWO TINY PEAS IN A VERY BIG POD
1578-6379-0003 AS THEY CAME TO A STOP THEY WERE BESIEGED BY A CROWD OF BLUE COATED GIRLS IT WAS AFTERNOON RECREATION AND THE WHOLE SCHOOL WAS ABROAD THE WELCOME THAT SHE RECEIVED WOULD HAVE LED AN ONLOOKER TO INFER THAT PATTY HAD BEEN GONE THREE MONTHS INSTEAD OF THREE DAYS SHE AND HER TWO
1578-6379-0004 POSTILIONS DESCENDED AND MARTIN GATHERED UP HIS REINS COME ON YOUSE ALL WHO WANTS A RIDE TO THE STABLES WAS HIS HOSPITABLE INVITATION IT INUNDATED HIM WITH PASSENGERS THEY CROWDED INSIDE TWICE AS MANY AS THE HEARSE WOULD HOLD

1578-6379-0008 MISS JELLINGS WAS INSISTENT THAT RECREATION SHOULD BE ACTIVELY PURSUED OUT OF DOORS THE TWO COULD EASILY HAVE OBTAINED PERMISSION TO GREET PATTY'S RETURN INSIDE BUT IT WAS THE POLICY OF THE TRIO NEVER TO ASK PERMISSION IN MINOR MATTERS IT WASTED ONE'S CREDIT UNNECESSARILY
1578-6379-0009 PRISCILLA AND CONNY TURNED UPSTAIRS LUGGING THE SUIT CASE BETWEEN THEM WHILE PATTY APPROACHED THE PRINCIPAL'S STUDY TEN MINUTES LATER SHE JOINED HER COMPANIONS IN SEVEN PARADISE ALLEY THEY WERE SITTING ON THE BED THEIR CHINS IN THEIR HANDS

1578-6379-0047 PUNCTUATED BY AN OCCASIONAL DEEP BASS LAUGH WHEN THEY HEARD THE FRONT DOOR CLOSE WITH ONE ACCORD THEY INVADED HARRIET GLADDEN'S ROOM WHICH COMMANDED THE WALK AND PRESSED THEIR NOSES AGAINST THE PANE A SHORT THICK SET MAN OF GERMAN BUILD WAS WADDLING TOWARD THE GATE AND THE TROLLEY CAR
1578-6379-0048 THEY GAZED WITH WIDE HORRIFIED EYES AND TURNED WITHOUT A WORD TO MEET PATTY AS SHE TRUDGED UPSTAIRS LUGGING HER ERRANT SUIT CASE A GLANCE TOLD HER THAT THEY HAD SEEN AND DROPPING ON THE TOP STEP SHE LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST THE RAILING AND LAUGHED
1594-135914-0000 IN THIS MISERABLE STATE THEY CAME TO THE FIRST VILLAGE THE PEASANTS WIVES FLOCKED ABOUT THEM AND AS IT APPEARED THROUGH THEIR DISGUISE THAT THEY WERE PEOPLE OF SOME CONDITION ASKED THEM WHAT WAS THE OCCASION OF THEIR TRAVELLING IN A HABIT THAT DID NOT SEEM TO BELONG TO THEM
1594-135914-0001 INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION THEY FELL TO WEEPING WHICH ONLY SERVED TO HEIGHTEN THE CURIOSITY OF THE PEASANTS AND TO MOVE THEIR COMPASSION GANEM'S MOTHER TOLD THEM WHAT SHE AND HER DAUGHTER HAD ENDURED AT WHICH THE GOOD COUNTRYWOMEN WERE SENSIBLY AFFLICTED
1594-135914-0002 AND ENDEAVOURED TO COMFORT THEM THEY TREATED THEM AS WELL AS THEIR POVERTY WOULD PERMIT TOOK OFF THEIR HORSE HAIR SHIFTS WHICH WERE VERY UNEASY TO THEM AND PUT ON THEM OTHERS WHICH THEY GAVE THEM WITH SHOES AND SOMETHING TO COVER THEIR HEADS AND SAVE THEIR HAIR
1594-135914-0003 JALIB AL KOOLLOOB AND HER MOTHER DEPARTED FROM THAT VILLAGE TAKING SHORT JOURNEYS TOWARDS ALEPPO THEY USED AT DUSK TO RETIRE NEAR OR INTO THE MOSQUES WHERE THEY PASSED THE NIGHT ON THE MAT IF THERE WAS ANY
1594-135914-0004 OR ELSE ON THE BARE PAVEMENT AND SOMETIMES RESTED IN THE PUBLIC PLACES APPOINTED FOR THE USE OF TRAVELLERS AS FOR SUSTENANCE THEY DID NOT WANT FOR THEY OFTEN CAME TO PLACES WHERE BREAD BOILED RICE AND OTHER PROVISIONS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL TRAVELLERS WHO DESIRE IT
1594-135914-0005 AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO ALEPPO BUT WOULD NOT STAY THERE AND CONTINUING THEIR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE EUPHRATES CROSSED THE RIVER
1594-135914-0006 THENCE NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEY HAD ENDURED THEY PROCEEDED TO BAGDAD THAT WAS THE PLACE THEY HAD FIXED THEIR THOUGHTS UPON
1594-135914-0007 BUT THEY HOPED BECAUSE THEY WISHED IT THEIR AFFECTION FOR HIM INCREASING INSTEAD OF DIMINISHING WITH THEIR MISFORTUNES THEIR CONVERSATION WAS GENERALLY ABOUT HIM AND THEY INQUIRED FOR HIM OF ALL THEY MET BUT LET US LEAVE JALIB AL KOOLLOOB AND HER MOTHER
1594-135914-0008 AND RETURN TO FETNAH SHE WAS STILL CONFINED CLOSELY IN THE DARK TOWER SINCE THE DAY THAT HAD BEEN SO FATAL TO GANEM AND HERSELF HOWEVER DISAGREEABLE AS HER PRISON WAS TO HER IT WAS MUCH LESS GRIEVOUS THAN THE THOUGHTS OF GANEM'S MISFORTUNE
1594-135914-0009 THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHOSE FATE WAS A KILLING AFFLICTION THERE WAS SCARCELY A MOMENT IN WHICH SHE DID NOT LAMENT HIM
1594-135914-0010 AND SOMETIMES BY THOSE NIGHT WALKS CAME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN HIS COURT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE REACHED HIS EAR ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS IN HIS WALK HE HAPPENED TO PASS BY THE DARK TOWER AND FANCYING HE HEARD SOMEBODY TALK
1594-135914-0011 STOPS AND DRAWING NEAR THE DOOR TO LISTEN DISTINCTLY HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH FETNAH WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE ALWAYS ON GANEM UTTERED WITH A LOUD VOICE O GANEM TOO UNFORTUNATE GANEM WHERE ARE YOU AT THIS TIME
1594-135914-0012 WHITHER HAS THY CRUEL FATE LED THEE ALAS IT IS I THAT HAVE MADE YOU WRETCHED WHY DID YOU NOT LET ME PERISH MISERABLY RATHER THAN AFFORD ME YOUR GENEROUS RELIEF WHAT MELANCHOLY RETURN HAVE YOU RECEIVED FOR YOUR CARE AND RESPECT
1594-135914-0013 THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WHO OUGHT TO HAVE REWARDED PERSECUTES YOU AND IN REQUITAL FOR HAVING ALWAYS REGARDED ME AS A PERSON RESERVED FOR HIS BED YOU LOSE YOUR FORTUNE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
1594-135914-0014 HOW CAN YOU EXCULPATE YOURSELF WHEN YOU SHALL APPEAR WITH GANEM BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF THE SUPREME JUDGE AND THE ANGELS SHALL TESTIFY THE TRUTH BEFORE YOUR FACE ALL THE POWER YOU ARE NOW INVESTED WITH AND WHICH MAKES ALMOST THE WHOLE WORLD TREMBLE
1594-135914-0015 WILL NOT PREVENT YOUR BEING CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED FOR YOUR VIOLENT AND UNJUST PROCEEDINGS HERE FETNAH CEASED HER COMPLAINTS HER SIGHS AND TEARS PUTTING A STOP TO HER UTTERANCE
1594-135914-0016 HE PLAINLY PERCEIVED THAT IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD WAS TRUE HIS FAVOURITE MUST BE INNOCENT AND THAT HE HAD BEEN TOO HASTY IN GIVING SUCH ORDERS AGAINST GANEM AND HIS FAMILY
1594-135914-0017 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT THE THOUGHT FOR HE RESPECTED FETNAH AND HAD BEEN MUCH CONCERNED AT HER DISGRACE THEREFORE FLYING INSTANTLY TO THE TOWER MADAM SAID HE TO THE FAVOURITE WITH SUCH AN AIR AS EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION BE PLEASED TO FOLLOW ME
1594-135914-0018 I HOPE YOU WILL NEVER MORE RETURN TO THIS MELANCHOLY ABODE THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WISHES TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND I DRAW FROM THIS A HAPPY OMEN
1594-135914-0019 SHE PROSTRATED HERSELF BEFORE HIM AND SO CONTINUED HER FACE BATHED IN TEARS
1594-135914-0020 I THINK YOU CHARGE ME WITH VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WHO IS HE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE REGARD AND RESPELL HE HAD FOR ME IS IN A MISERABLE CONDITION SPEAK FREELY
1594-135914-0021 YOU KNOW THE NATURAL GOODNESS OF MY DISPOSITION AND THAT I LOVE TO DO JUSTICE BY THESE WORDS
1594-135914-0022 COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS SAID SHE IF I HAVE LET FALL ANY WORD THAT IS NOT AGREEABLE TO YOUR MAJESTY I MOST HUMBLY BESEECH YOU TO FORGIVE ME BUT HE WHOSE INNOCENCE AND WRETCHED STATE YOU DESIRE TO BE INFORMED OF
1594-135914-0023 IS GANEM THE UNHAPPY SON OF ABOU AYOUB LATE A RICH MERCHANT OF DAMASCUS HE SAVED MY LIFE FROM A GRAVE AND AFFORDED ME A SANCTUARY IN HIS HOUSE
1594-135914-0024 I MUST OWN THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT HE SAW ME HE PERHAPS DESIGNED TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO ME AND CONCEIVED HOPES OF ENGAGING ME TO ADMIT HIS LOVE I GUESSED AT THIS BY THE EAGERNESS WHICH HE SHEWED IN ENTERTAINING ME
1594-135914-0025 AND DOING ME ALL THE GOOD OFFICES I SO MUCH WANTED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS THEN IN BUT AS SOON AS HE HEARD THAT I HAD THE HONOUR TO BELONG TO YOU AH MADAM SAID HE THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE MASTER IS FORBIDDEN TO THE SLAVE FROM THAT MOMENT
1594-135914-0026 I OWE THIS JUSTICE TO HIS VIRTUE TO DECLARE HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS ALWAYS SUITABLE TO HIS WORDS YOU COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS WELL KNOW WITH WHAT RIGOUR YOU HAVE TREATED HIM AND YOU WILL ANSWER FOR IT BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF GOD
1594-135914-0027 I MUST MAKE A CONFESSION WHICH PERHAPS MAY DISPLEASE YOU BUT I BEG PARDON OF YOUR MAJESTY BEFOREHAND SPEAK DAUGHTER SAID HAROON AL RUSHEED I FORGIVE YOU ALL PROVIDED YOU CONCEAL NOTHING FROM ME WELL THEN REPLIED FETNAH
1594-135914-0028 LET ME INFORM YOU THAT GANEM'S RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOUR JOINED TO ALL THE GOOD OFFICES HE DID ME GAINED HIM MY ESTEEM I WENT FURTHER YET YOU KNOW THE TYRANNY OF LOVE I FELT SOME TENDER INCLINATION RISING IN MY BREAST
1594-135914-0029 HE PERCEIVED IT BUT FAR FROM AVAILING HIMSELF OF MY FRAILTY AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FLAME WHICH CONSUMED HIM HE STILL REMAINED STEADY IN HIS DUTY AND ALL THAT HIS PASSION COULD FORCE FROM HIM WERE THE WORDS I HAVE ALREADY REPEATED TO YOUR MAJESTY
1594-135914-0030 THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE MASTER IS FORBIDDEN TO THE SLAVE THIS INGENUOUS CONFESSION
1594-135914-0031 AND ENLARGING ON THE OBLIGATIONS SHE OWED TO GANEM BUT ABOVE ALL SHE HIGHLY EXTOLLED HIS DISCRETION
1594-135914-0032 WHEN SHE HAD DONE SPEAKING
1594-135914-0033 I BELIEVE ALL YOU HAVE TOLD ME BUT WHY WAS IT SO LONG BEFORE YOU LET ME HEAR FROM YOU WAS THERE ANY NEED OF STAYING A WHOLE MONTH AFTER MY RETURN BEFORE YOU SENT ME WORD WHERE YOU WERE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS ANSWERED FETNAH
