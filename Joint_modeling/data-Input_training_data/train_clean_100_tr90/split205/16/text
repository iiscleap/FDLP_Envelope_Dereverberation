150-126107-0004 OR IN SHORT THE POWER OF MAKING IMPRESSIONS UPON THE RADICAL SENSORIUM SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER SHE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE OF COURSE HE MADE NO FURTHER INQUIRIES ABOUT HER
150-126107-0005 ONE DAY HE LOST SIGHT OF HIS RETINUE IN A GREAT FOREST THESE FORESTS ARE VERY USEFUL IN DELIVERING PRINCES FROM THEIR COURTIERS LIKE A SIEVE THAT KEEPS BACK THE BRAN THEN THE PRINCES GET AWAY TO FOLLOW THEIR FORTUNES
150-126107-0006 IN THIS WAY THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRINCESSES WHO ARE FORCED TO MARRY BEFORE THEY HAVE HAD A BIT OF FUN I WISH OUR PRINCESSES GOT LOST IN A FOREST SOMETIMES ONE LOVELY EVENING AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR MANY DAYS
150-126107-0007 HE FOUND THAT HE WAS APPROACHING THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS FOREST FOR THE TREES HAD GOT SO THIN THAT HE COULD SEE THE SUNSET THROUGH THEM AND HE SOON CAME UPON A KIND OF HEATH NEXT HE CAME UPON SIGNS OF HUMAN NEIGHBOURHOOD
150-126107-0008 AT LENGTH HE ENTERED ANOTHER WOOD NOT A WILD FOREST BUT A CIVILIZED WOOD THROUGH WHICH A FOOTPATH LED HIM TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE ALONG THIS PATH THE PRINCE PURSUED HIS WAY THROUGH THE GATHERING DARKNESS
150-126107-0009 SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AND LISTENED STRANGE SOUNDS CAME ACROSS THE WATER IT WAS IN FACT THE PRINCESS LAUGHING NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD IN HER LAUGH AS I HAVE ALREADY HINTED
150-126107-0010 FOR THE HATCHING OF A REAL HEARTY LAUGH REQUIRES THE INCUBATION OF GRAVITY AND PERHAPS THIS WAS HOW THE PRINCE MISTOOK THE LAUGHTER FOR SCREAMING LOOKING OVER THE LAKE HE SAW SOMETHING WHITE IN THE WATER AND IN AN INSTANT HE HAD TORN OFF HIS TUNIC
150-126107-0011 NOW I CANNOT TELL HOW IT CAME ABOUT WHETHER SHE PRETENDED TO BE DROWNING OR WHETHER HE FRIGHTENED HER OR CAUGHT HER SO AS TO EMBARRASS HER BUT CERTAINLY HE BROUGHT HER TO SHORE IN A FASHION IGNOMINIOUS TO A SWIMMER
150-126107-0012 AND MORE NEARLY DROWNED THAN SHE HAD EVER EXPECTED TO BE FOR THE WATER HAD GOT INTO HER THROAT AS OFTEN AS SHE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK AT THE PLACE TO WHICH HE BORE HER THE BANK WAS ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE WATER
150-126107-0013 SO HE GAVE HER A STRONG LIFT OUT OF THE WATER TO LAY HER ON THE BANK BUT HER GRAVITATION CEASING THE MOMENT SHE LEFT THE WATER AWAY SHE WENT UP INTO THE AIR SCOLDING AND SCREAMING
150-126107-0014 YOU NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY MAN SHE CRIED NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING HER INTO A PASSION BEFORE WHEN THE PRINCE SAW HER ASCEND HE THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED
150-126107-0015 THE PRINCE MEANTIME STOOD IN THE WATER STARING AND FORGETTING TO GET OUT BUT THE PRINCESS DISAPPEARING HE SCRAMBLED ON SHORE AND WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TREE
150-126107-0016 UNTIL REACHING THE GROUND AND SEEING HIM STANDING THERE SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM AND SAID I'LL TELL PAPA OH NO YOU WON'T RETURNED THE PRINCE YES I WILL SHE PERSISTED
150-126107-0017 WHAT BUSINESS HAD YOU TO PULL ME DOWN OUT OF THE WATER AND THROW ME TO THE BOTTOM OF THE AIR I NEVER DID YOU ANY HARM PARDON ME I DID NOT MEAN TO HURT YOU I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY BRAINS AND THAT IS A WORSE LOSS THAN YOUR WRETCHED GRAVITY
150-126107-0018 I PITY YOU THE PRINCE NOW SAW THAT HE HAD COME UPON THE BEWITCHED PRINCESS AND HAD ALREADY OFFENDED HER BUT BEFORE HE COULD THINK WHAT TO SAY NEXT SHE BURST OUT ANGRILY GIVING A STAMP WITH HER FOOT
150-126107-0019 THAT WOULD HAVE SENT HER ALOFT AGAIN BUT FOR THE HOLD SHE HAD OF HIS ARM PUT ME UP DIRECTLY PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER ALMOST ALREADY
150-126107-0020 FOR HER ANGER MADE HER MORE CHARMING THAN ANY ONE ELSE HAD EVER BEHELD HER AND AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE WHICH CERTAINLY WAS NOT FAR SHE HAD NOT A SINGLE FAULT ABOUT HER EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT SHE HAD NOT ANY GRAVITY
150-126107-0021 NO PRINCE HOWEVER WOULD JUDGE OF A PRINCESS BY WEIGHT THE LOVELINESS OF HER FOOT HE WOULD HARDLY ESTIMATE BY THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION IT COULD MAKE IN MUD PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE IN THE WATER YOU STUPID
150-126107-0022 ANSWERED THE PRINCESS COME THEN SAID THE PRINCE THE CONDITION OF HER DRESS INCREASING HER USUAL DIFFICULTY IN WALKING COMPELLED HER TO CLING TO HIM AND HE COULD HARDLY PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT IN A DELIGHTFUL DREAM
150-126107-0023 HE TURNED TOWARDS THE PRINCESS AND SAID HOW AM I TO PUT YOU IN THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS SHE ANSWERED QUITE SNAPPISHLY
150-126107-0024 VERY WELL SAID THE PRINCE AND CATCHING HER UP IN HIS ARMS HE SPRANG WITH HER FROM THE ROCK THE PRINCESS HAD JUST TIME TO GIVE ONE DELIGHTED SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER BEFORE THE WATER CLOSED OVER THEM
150-126107-0025 IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE GOING UP REJOINED SHE MY FEELING WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF ELEVATION TOO THE PRINCE CONCEDED THE PRINCESS DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM FOR SHE RETORTED HIS QUESTION
150-126107-0026 SAID THE PRINCESS BEYOND EVERYTHING ANSWERED HE FOR I HAVE FALLEN IN WITH THE ONLY PERFECT CREATURE I EVER SAW NO MORE OF THAT I AM TIRED OF IT SAID THE PRINCESS PERHAPS SHE SHARED HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO PUNNING
150-126107-0027 DON'T YOU LIKE FALLING IN THEN SAID THE PRINCE IT IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL FUN I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE ANSWERED SHE I NEVER FELL BEFORE I WISH I COULD LEARN
150-126107-0028 TO THINK I AM THE ONLY PERSON IN MY FATHER'S KINGDOM THAT CAN'T FALL HERE THE POOR PRINCESS LOOKED ALMOST SAD I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO FALL IN WITH YOU ANY TIME YOU LIKE SAID THE PRINCE DEVOTEDLY THANK YOU
150-126107-0029 I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER BUT I DON'T CARE AT ALL EVENTS AS WE HAVE FALLEN IN LET US HAVE A SWIM TOGETHER WITH ALL MY HEART RESPONDED THE PRINCE
150-126107-0030 AND AWAY THEY WENT SWIMMING AND DIVING AND FLOATING UNTIL AT LAST THEY HEARD CRIES ALONG THE SHORE AND SAW LIGHTS GLANCING IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS NOW QUITE LATE AND THERE WAS NO MOON I MUST GO HOME SAID THE PRINCESS
150-126107-0031 AT LEAST I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHERE IT IS I WISH I HADN'T ONE EITHER REJOINED THE PRINCESS IT IS SO STUPID I HAVE A GREAT MIND SHE CONTINUED TO PLAY THEM ALL A TRICK WHY COULDN'T THEY LEAVE ME ALONE
150-126107-0032 THEY WON'T TRUST ME IN THE LAKE FOR A SINGLE NIGHT YOU SEE WHERE THAT GREEN LIGHT IS BURNING THAT IS THE WINDOW OF MY ROOM NOW IF YOU WOULD JUST SWIM THERE WITH ME VERY QUIETLY AND WHEN WE ARE ALL BUT UNDER THE BALCONY
150-126107-0033 AS YOU DID A LITTLE WHILE AGO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CATCH HOLD OF THE BALCONY AND GET IN AT THE WINDOW AND THEN THEY MAY LOOK FOR ME TILL TO MORROW MORNING WITH MORE OBEDIENCE THAN PLEASURE SAID THE PRINCE GALLANTLY AND AWAY THEY SWAM VERY GENTLY
150-126107-0034 WILL YOU BE IN THE LAKE TO MORROW NIGHT THE PRINCE VENTURED TO ASK TO BE SURE I WILL I DON'T THINK SO PERHAPS WAS THE PRINCESS'S SOMEWHAT STRANGE ANSWER
150-126107-0035 AND MERELY WHISPERED AS HE GAVE HER THE PARTING LIFT DON'T TELL THE ONLY ANSWER THE PRINCESS RETURNED WAS A ROGUISH LOOK SHE WAS ALREADY A YARD ABOVE HIS HEAD THE LOOK SEEMED TO SAY NEVER FEAR IT IS TOO GOOD FUN TO SPOIL THAT WAY
150-126107-0036 SO PERFECTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAD SHE BEEN IN THE WATER THAT EVEN YET THE PRINCE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN HE SAW HER ASCEND SLOWLY GRASP THE BALCONY AND DISAPPEAR THROUGH THE WINDOW
150-126107-0037 HE TURNED ALMOST EXPECTING TO SEE HER STILL BY HIS SIDE BUT HE WAS ALONE IN THE WATER SO HE SWAM AWAY QUIETLY AND WATCHED THE LIGHTS ROVING ABOUT THE SHORE FOR HOURS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS SAFE IN HER CHAMBER
150-126107-0038 AS SOON AS THEY DISAPPEARED HE LANDED IN SEARCH OF HIS TUNIC AND SWORD AND AFTER SOME TROUBLE FOUND THEM AGAIN THEN HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY ROUND THE LAKE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE THE WOOD WAS WILDER
150-126107-0039 AND THE SHORE STEEPER RISING MORE IMMEDIATELY TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS WHICH SURROUNDED THE LAKE ON ALL SIDES AND KEPT SENDING IT MESSAGES OF SILVERY STREAMS FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AND ALL NIGHT LONG HE SOON FOUND A SPOT WHENCE HE COULD SEE THE GREEN LIGHT IN THE PRINCESS'S ROOM
150-126107-0040 AND WHERE EVEN IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT HE WOULD BE IN NO DANGER OF BEING DISCOVERED FROM THE OPPOSITE SHORE IT WAS A SORT OF CAVE IN THE ROCK WHERE HE PROVIDED HIMSELF A BED OF WITHERED LEAVES AND LAY DOWN TOO TIRED FOR HUNGER TO KEEP HIM AWAKE
150-126112-0000 THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU THE PRINCE WENT TO DRESS FOR THE OCCASION FOR HE WAS RESOLVED TO DIE LIKE A PRINCE WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THAT A MAN HAD OFFERED TO DIE FOR HER
150-126112-0001 SHE WAS SO TRANSPORTED THAT SHE JUMPED OFF THE BED FEEBLE AS SHE WAS AND DANCED ABOUT THE ROOM FOR JOY SHE DID NOT CARE WHO THE MAN WAS THAT WAS NOTHING TO HER THE HOLE WANTED STOPPING AND IF ONLY A MAN WOULD DO WHY TAKE ONE
150-126112-0002 WHERE THEY HAD ALREADY PLACED A LITTLE BOAT FOR HER THE WATER WAS NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT IT BUT THEY HOPED IT WOULD BE BEFORE LONG THEY LAID HER ON CUSHIONS PLACED IN THE BOAT WINES AND FRUITS AND OTHER NICE THINGS AND STRETCHED A CANOPY OVER ALL
150-126112-0003 IN A FEW MINUTES THE PRINCE APPEARED THE PRINCESS RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE BUT DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM HERE I AM SAID THE PRINCE PUT ME IN
150-126112-0004 THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A SHOEBLACK SAID THE PRINCESS SO I AM SAID THE PRINCE I BLACKED YOUR LITTLE BOOTS THREE TIMES A DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL I COULD GET OF YOU PUT ME IN
150-126112-0005 THE COURTIERS DID NOT RESENT HIS BLUNTNESS EXCEPT BY SAYING TO EACH OTHER THAT HE WAS TAKING IT OUT IN IMPUDENCE BUT HOW WAS HE TO BE PUT IN THE GOLDEN PLATE CONTAINED NO INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS POINT
150-126112-0006 THE PRINCE LOOKED AT THE HOLE AND SAW BUT ONE WAY HE PUT BOTH HIS LEGS INTO IT SITTING ON THE STONE AND STOOPING FORWARD COVERED THE CORNER THAT REMAINED OPEN WITH HIS TWO HANDS IN THIS UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION
150-126112-0007 HE RESOLVED TO ABIDE HIS FATE AND TURNING TO THE PEOPLE SAID NOW YOU CAN GO THE KING HAD ALREADY GONE HOME TO DINNER NOW YOU CAN GO REPEATED THE PRINCESS AFTER HIM LIKE A PARROT
150-126112-0008 THE PEOPLE OBEYED HER AND WENT PRESENTLY A LITTLE WAVE FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED ONE OF THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT MUCH
150-126112-0009 AND A LONG PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU PRINCE SAID THE PRINCESS AT LAST QUITE COOLLY AS SHE LAY IN THE BOAT WITH HER EYES SHUT I AM SORRY I CAN'T RETURN THE COMPLIMENT
150-126112-0010 THOUGHT THE PRINCE BUT YOU ARE WORTH DYING FOR AFTER ALL AGAIN A WAVELET AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED BOTH THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK OR MOVE
150-126112-0011 TWO THREE FOUR HOURS PASSED IN THIS WAY THE PRINCESS APPARENTLY ASLEEP AND THE PRINCE VERY PATIENT BUT HE WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED IN HIS POSITION FOR HE HAD NONE OF THE CONSOLATION HE HAD HOPED FOR
150-126112-0012 AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER PRINCESS SAID HE BUT AT THE MOMENT UP STARTED THE PRINCESS CRYING I'M AFLOAT I'M AFLOAT AND THE LITTLE BOAT BUMPED AGAINST THE STONE PRINCESS
150-126112-0013 REPEATED THE PRINCE ENCOURAGED BY SEEING HER WIDE AWAKE AND LOOKING EAGERLY AT THE WATER WELL SAID SHE WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND
150-126112-0014 AND YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT ME ONCE DID HE THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST BUT I AM SO SLEEPY SLEEP THEN DARLING AND DON'T MIND ME SAID THE POOR PRINCE
150-126112-0015 REPLIED THE PRINCESS I THINK I WILL GO TO SLEEP AGAIN JUST GIVE ME A GLASS OF WINE AND A BISCUIT FIRST SAID THE PRINCE VERY HUMBLY WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE PRINCESS AND GAPED AS SHE SAID IT
150-126112-0016 FEELING VERY FAINT INDEED ONLY I SHALL DIE BEFORE IT IS OF ANY USE TO YOU UNLESS I HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT THERE THEN SAID SHE HOLDING OUT THE WINE TO HIM AH YOU MUST FEED ME I DARE NOT MOVE MY HANDS
150-126112-0017 AND SHE BEGAN AT ONCE TO FEED HIM WITH BITS OF BISCUIT AND SIPS OF WINE AS SHE FED HIM HE CONTRIVED TO KISS THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS NOW AND THEN SHE DID NOT SEEM TO MIND IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT THE PRINCE FELT BETTER
150-126112-0018 NOW FOR YOUR OWN SAKE PRINCESS SAID HE I CANNOT LET YOU GO TO SLEEP YOU MUST SIT AND LOOK AT ME ELSE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WELL I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN TO OBLIGE YOU
150-126112-0019 ANSWERED SHE WITH CONDESCENSION AND SITTING DOWN SHE DID LOOK AT HIM AND KEPT LOOKING AT HIM WITH WONDERFUL STEADINESS CONSIDERING ALL THINGS THE SUN WENT DOWN AND THE MOON ROSE
150-126112-0020 AND GUSH AFTER GUSH THE WATERS WERE RISING UP THE PRINCE'S BODY THEY WERE UP TO HIS WAIST NOW WHY CAN'T WE GO AND HAVE A SWIM SAID THE PRINCESS
150-126112-0021 I SHALL NEVER SWIM MORE SAID THE PRINCE OH I FORGOT SAID THE PRINCESS AND WAS SILENT SO THE WATER GREW AND GREW AND ROSE UP AND UP ON THE PRINCE
150-126112-0022 AND THE PRINCESS SAT AND LOOKED AT HIM SHE FED HIM NOW AND THEN THE NIGHT WORE ON THE WATERS ROSE AND ROSE THE MOON ROSE LIKEWISE HIGHER AND HIGHER
150-126112-0023 AND SHONE FULL ON THE FACE OF THE DYING PRINCE THE WATER WAS UP TO HIS NECK WILL YOU KISS ME PRINCESS SAID HE FEEBLY THE NONCHALANCE WAS ALL GONE NOW
150-126112-0024 YES I WILL ANSWERED THE PRINCESS AND KISSED HIM WITH A LONG SWEET COLD KISS NOW SAID HE WITH A SIGH OF CONTENT I DIE HAPPY
150-126112-0025 HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN THE PRINCESS GAVE HIM SOME WINE FOR THE LAST TIME HE WAS PAST EATING THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND LOOKED AT HIM THE WATER ROSE AND ROSE
150-126112-0026 IT TOUCHED HIS CHIN IT TOUCHED HIS LOWER LIP IT TOUCHED BETWEEN HIS LIPS HE SHUT THEM HARD TO KEEP IT OUT THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO FEEL STRANGE IT TOUCHED HIS UPPER LIP
150-126112-0027 HE BREATHED THROUGH HIS NOSTRILS THE PRINCESS LOOKED WILD IT COVERED HIS NOSTRILS HER EYES LOOKED SCARED AND SHONE STRANGE IN THE MOONLIGHT HIS HEAD FELL BACK THE WATER CLOSED OVER IT
150-126112-0028 AND THE BUBBLES OF HIS LAST BREATH BUBBLED UP THROUGH THE WATER THE PRINCESS GAVE A SHRIEK AND SPRANG INTO THE LAKE SHE LAID HOLD FIRST OF ONE LEG AND THEN OF THE OTHER AND PULLED AND TUGGED BUT SHE COULD NOT MOVE EITHER SHE STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
150-126112-0029 AND THAT MADE HER THINK THAT HE COULD NOT GET ANY BREATH SHE WAS FRANTIC SHE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND HELD HIS HEAD ABOVE THE WATER WHICH WAS POSSIBLE NOW HIS HANDS WERE NO LONGER ON THE HOLE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE FOR HE WAS PAST BREATHING
150-126112-0030 LOVE AND WATER BROUGHT BACK ALL HER STRENGTH SHE GOT UNDER THE WATER AND PULLED AND PULLED WITH HER WHOLE MIGHT TILL AT LAST SHE GOT ONE LEG OUT THE OTHER EASILY FOLLOWED HOW SHE GOT HIM INTO THE BOAT SHE NEVER COULD TELL
150-126112-0031 BUT WHEN SHE DID SHE FAINTED AWAY COMING TO HERSELF SHE SEIZED THE OARS KEPT HERSELF STEADY AS BEST SHE COULD AND ROWED AND ROWED THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ROWED BEFORE ROUND ROCKS AND OVER SHALLOWS AND THROUGH MUD SHE ROWED
150-126112-0032 TILL SHE GOT TO THE LANDING STAIRS OF THE PALACE BY THIS TIME HER PEOPLE WERE ON THE SHORE FOR THEY HAD HEARD HER SHRIEK SHE MADE THEM CARRY THE PRINCE TO HER OWN ROOM AND LAY HIM IN HER BED AND LIGHT A FIRE AND SEND FOR THE DOCTORS
150-126112-0033 BUT THE LAKE YOUR HIGHNESS SAID THE CHAMBERLAIN WHO ROUSED BY THE NOISE CAME IN IN HIS NIGHTCAP GO AND DROWN YOURSELF IN IT SHE SAID THIS WAS THE LAST RUDENESS OF WHICH THE PRINCESS WAS EVER GUILTY
150-126112-0034 AND ONE MUST ALLOW THAT SHE HAD GOOD CAUSE TO FEEL PROVOKED WITH THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN HAD IT BEEN THE KING HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE FARED NO BETTER BUT BOTH HE AND THE QUEEN WERE FAST ASLEEP AND THE CHAMBERLAIN WENT BACK TO HIS BED
150-126112-0035 SOMEHOW THE DOCTORS NEVER CAME SO THE PRINCESS AND HER OLD NURSE WERE LEFT WITH THE PRINCE BUT THE OLD NURSE WAS A WISE WOMAN AND KNEW WHAT TO DO THEY TRIED EVERYTHING FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT SUCCESS
150-126112-0036 THE PRINCESS WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED BETWEEN HOPE AND FEAR BUT SHE TRIED ON AND ON ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER AND EVERYTHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT LAST WHEN THEY HAD ALL BUT GIVEN IT UP JUST AS THE SUN ROSE
150-132655-0000 BUT THE EXTREME IMPERTINENCE OF THE BARON DETERMINED HIM TO CONCLUDE THE MATCH
150-132655-0001 CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT
150-132655-0002 THEY SAID NOT A WORD TO HIS SISTER THE THING WAS EXECUTED FOR A LITTLE MONEY AND THEY HAD THE DOUBLE PLEASURE OF ENTRAPPING A JESUIT AND PUNISHING THE PRIDE OF A GERMAN BARON
150-132655-0003 IT IS NATURAL TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER SO MANY DISASTERS CANDIDE MARRIED AND LIVING WITH THE PHILOSOPHER PANGLOSS THE PHILOSOPHER MARTIN THE PRUDENT CACAMBO AND THE OLD WOMAN
150-132655-0004 HAVING BESIDES BROUGHT SO MANY DIAMONDS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE ANCIENT INCAS MUST HAVE LED A VERY HAPPY LIFE BUT HE WAS SO MUCH IMPOSED UPON BY THE JEWS THAT HE HAD NOTHING LEFT EXCEPT HIS SMALL FARM
150-132655-0005 HIS WIFE BECAME UGLIER EVERY DAY MORE PEEVISH AND UNSUPPORTABLE THE OLD WOMAN WAS INFIRM AND EVEN MORE FRETFUL THAN CUNEGONDE CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE
150-132655-0006 AND THEY SAW OTHER CADIS PASHAS AND EFFENDIS COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
150-132655-0007 I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS WORSE TO BE RAVISHED A HUNDRED TIMES BY NEGRO PIRATES
150-132655-0008 IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO
150-132655-0009 THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
150-132655-0010 PANGLOSS OWNED THAT HE HAD ALWAYS SUFFERED HORRIBLY BUT AS HE HAD ONCE ASSERTED THAT EVERYTHING WENT WONDERFULLY WELL HE ASSERTED IT STILL THOUGH HE NO LONGER BELIEVED IT WHAT HELPED TO CONFIRM MARTIN IN HIS DETESTABLE PRINCIPLES
150-132655-0011 THEY HAD SOON SQUANDERED THEIR THREE THOUSAND PIASTRES PARTED WERE RECONCILED QUARRELLED AGAIN
150-132655-0012 THAT YOUR PRESENTS WOULD SOON BE DISSIPATED AND ONLY MAKE THEM THE MORE MISERABLE YOU HAVE ROLLED IN MILLIONS OF MONEY YOU AND CACAMBO
150-132655-0013 HA SAID PANGLOSS TO PAQUETTE PROVIDENCE HAS THEN BROUGHT YOU AMONGST US AGAIN MY POOR CHILD DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU COST ME THE TIP OF MY NOSE AN EYE AND AN EAR AS YOU MAY SEE WHAT A WORLD IS THIS
150-132655-0014 AND NOW THIS NEW ADVENTURE SET THEM PHILOSOPHISING MORE THAN EVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER
150-132655-0015 MASTER SAID HE WE COME TO BEG YOU TO TELL WHY SO STRANGE AN ANIMAL AS MAN WAS MADE WITH WHAT MEDDLEST THOU SAID THE DERVISH IS IT THY BUSINESS
150-132655-0016 THERE IS HORRIBLE EVIL IN THIS WORLD WHAT SIGNIFIES IT SAID THE DERVISH WHETHER THERE BE EVIL OR GOOD WHEN HIS HIGHNESS SENDS A SHIP TO EGYPT DOES HE TROUBLE HIS HEAD WHETHER THE MICE ON BOARD ARE AT THEIR EASE OR NOT
150-132655-0017 WHAT THEN MUST WE DO SAID PANGLOSS HOLD YOUR TONGUE ANSWERED THE DERVISH I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL
150-132655-0018 AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
150-132655-0019 ASKED THE OLD MAN WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE STRANGLED MUFTI I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED THE WORTHY MAN AND I HAVE NOT KNOWN THE NAME OF ANY MUFTI NOR OF ANY VIZIER I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
150-132655-0020 I PRESUME IN GENERAL THAT THEY WHO MEDDLE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS DIE SOMETIMES MISERABLY AND THAT THEY DESERVE IT BUT I NEVER TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT WHAT IS TRANSACTING AT CONSTANTINOPLE
150-132655-0021 I CONTENT MYSELF WITH SENDING THERE FOR SALE THE FRUITS OF THE GARDEN WHICH I CULTIVATE HAVING SAID THESE WORDS HE INVITED THE STRANGERS INTO HIS HOUSE HIS TWO SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS PRESENTED THEM WITH SEVERAL SORTS OF SHERBET WHICH THEY MADE THEMSELVES
150-132655-0022 WITH KAIMAK ENRICHED WITH THE CANDIED PEEL OF CITRONS WITH ORANGES LEMONS PINE APPLES PISTACHIO NUTS AND MOCHA COFFEE UNADULTERATED WITH THE BAD COFFEE OF BATAVIA OR THE AMERICAN ISLANDS
150-132655-0023 YOU MUST HAVE A VAST AND MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID CANDIDE TO THE TURK I HAVE ONLY TWENTY ACRES REPLIED THE OLD MAN I AND MY CHILDREN CULTIVATE THEM OUR LABOUR PRESERVES US FROM THREE GREAT EVILS WEARINESS VICE AND WANT
150-132655-0024 MADE PROFOUND REFLECTIONS ON THE OLD MAN'S CONVERSATION THIS HONEST TURK SAID HE TO PANGLOSS AND MARTIN SEEMS TO BE IN A SITUATION FAR PREFERABLE TO THAT OF THE SIX KINGS WITH WHOM WE HAD THE HONOUR OF SUPPING
150-132655-0025 GRANDEUR SAID PANGLOSS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF PHILOSOPHERS FOR IN SHORT EGLON KING OF MOAB WAS ASSASSINATED BY EHUD ABSALOM WAS HUNG BY HIS HAIR AND PIERCED WITH THREE DARTS
