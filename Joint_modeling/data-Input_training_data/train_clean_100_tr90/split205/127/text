4853-27671-0008 WHEN SHE SHOULD BE LAUNCHED AND LYING ALONGSIDE RAN HER MIDWAY OUT BY THE TACKLE AND ATTACHING A LINE TO A RING BOLT IN HER BOW SHOVED HER OVER THE SIDE AND SHE FELL WITH A SPLASH SHIPPING SCARCE A HATFUL OF WATER
4853-27671-0009 BUT I MET WITH AN OAR THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE OTHER BOAT AND THIS WITH THE MAST AND SAIL I DROPPED INTO HER THE SWELL LIFTING HER UP TO MY HAND WHEN THE BLUE FOLD SWUNG PAST MY NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO VICTUAL HER
4853-27671-0010 I RAN TO THE CABIN BUT THE LAZARETTE WAS FULL OF WATER AND NONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN IT TO BE COME AT I THEREUPON RANSACKED THE CABIN AND FOUND A WHOLE DUTCH CHEESE A PIECE OF RAW PORK HALF A HAM
4853-27671-0011 EIGHT OR TEN BISCUITS SOME CANDLES A TINDER BOX SEVERAL LEMONS A LITTLE BAG OF FLOWER AND THIRTEEN BOTTLES OF BEER THESE THINGS I ROLLED UP IN A CLOTH AND PLACED THEM IN THE BOAT
4853-27671-0012 THE HEAVY SLUGGISH SODDEN MOVEMENT OF THE HULL ADVISED ME TO MAKE HASTE SHE WAS NOW BARELY LIFTING TO THE SWELL THAT CAME BRIMMING IN BROAD LIQUID BLUE BROWS TO HER STEM
4853-27671-0013 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ANOTHER TON OF WATER WOULD SINK HER AND IF THE SWELL FELL OVER HER BOWS AND FILLED THE DECKS DOWN SHE WOULD GO I HAD A SMALL PARCEL OF GUINEAS IN MY CHEST AND WAS ABOUT TO FETCH THIS MONEY
4853-27671-0014 WHEN A SORT OF STAGGERING SENSATION IN THE UPWARD SLIDE OF THE HULL GAVE ME A FRIGHT AND WATCHING MY CHANCE I JUMPED INTO THE BOAT AND CAST THE LINE THAT HELD HER ADRIFT THE SUN WAS AN HOUR ABOVE THE HORIZON
4853-27671-0015 HEAVING VERY SLOWLY THOUGH YOU FELT THE WEIGHT OF THE MIGHTY OCEAN IN EVERY FOLD AND EASTWARDS THE SHOULDERS OF THE SWELL CATCHING THE GLORIOUS REFLECTION OF THE SUN HURLED THE SPLENDOUR ALONG
4853-27671-0016 TILL ALL THAT QUARTER OF THE SEA LOOKED TO BE A MASS OF LEAPING DAZZLE UPON THE EASTERN SEA LINE LAY A RANGE OF WHITE CLOUDS COMPACT AS THE CHALK CLIFFS OF DOVER
4853-27671-0017 SHOT WITH PEARLY LUSTRE FLOATED OVERHEAD VERY HIGH IT WAS IN TRUTH A FAIR AND PLEASANT MORNING OF AN ICY COLDNESS INDEED BUT THE AIR BEING DRY ITS SHREWDNESS WAS ENDURABLE
4853-27671-0018 WITH US HAD IT DAWNED YESTERDAY INSTEAD OF TO DAY MY COMPANIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALIVE AND YONDER SINKING RUINED FABRIC A TRIM SHIP CAPABLE OF BEARING US STOUTLY INTO WARM SEAS AND TO OUR HOMES AT LAST
4853-27671-0019 I THREW THE OAR OVER THE STERN OF THE BOAT TO KEEP HER NEAR TO THE BRIG NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE I DESIRED TO SEE THE LAST OF HER
4853-27671-0020 INTO THOSE PRODIGIOUS LEAGUES OF OCEAN WHICH LAY STRETCHED UNDER THE SKY WHILST THE HULL FLOATED SHE WAS SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO SO TO SAY SOMETHING FOR THE EYE AMID THE VASTNESS OF WATER TO REST UPON
4853-27671-0021 AND HER MAIN DECK BLEW UP WITH A LOUD CLAP OR BLAST OF NOISE I COULD FOLLOW THE LINE OF HER BULWARKS FLUCTUATING AND WAVING IN THE CLEAR DARK BLUE WHEN SHE WAS SOME FEET UNDER
4853-27671-0022 AND WHICH SHE DRAGGED DOWN WITH HER ON A SUDDEN WHEN THE LAST FRAGMENT OF MAST HAD DISAPPEARED AND WHEN THE HOLLOWS OF THE WHIRLPOOLS WERE FLATTENING TO THE LEVEL SURFACE OF THE SEA UP ROSE A BODY WITH A SORT OF LEAP
4853-27671-0023 IT WAS THE SAILOR THAT HAD LAIN DROWNED ON THE STARBOARD SIDE OF THE FORWARD DECK BEING FROZEN STIFF HE ROSE IN THE POSTURE IN WHICH HE HAD EXPIRED THAT IS WITH HIS ARMS EXTENDED
4853-27671-0024 SO THAT WHEN HE JUMPED TO THE SURFACE HE CAME WITH HIS HANDS LIFTED UP TO HEAVEN AND THUS HE STAYED A MINUTE SUSTAINED BY THE EDDIES WHICH ALSO REVOLVED HIM THE SHOCK OCCASIONED BY THIS MELANCHOLY OBJECT WAS SO GREAT
4853-27671-0025 AND SUCH WAS THE STATE OF MY MIND THAT IMAGINATION MIGHT QUICKLY HAVE WORKED THE APPARITION HAD IT LINGERED INTO AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE UNSETTLING OF MY REASON I ROSE FROM THE SEAT ON TO WHICH I HAD SUNK AND LOOSED THE SAIL
4853-27671-0026 AND HAULING THE SHEET AFT PUT THE OAR OVER THE STERN AND BROUGHT THE LITTLE CRAFT'S HEAD TO AN EASTERLY COURSE THE DRAUGHT OF AIR WAS EXTREMELY WEAK AND SCARCE FURNISHED IMPULSE ENOUGH TO THE SAIL TO RAISE A BUBBLE ALONGSIDE
4853-27671-0027 THE BOAT WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET LONG
4853-27671-0028 ERE I COULD HEAVE A CIVILIZED COAST OR A HABITABLE ISLAND INTO VIEW AT THE START I HAD A MIND TO STEER NORTH WEST AND BLOW AS THE WIND WOULD SUFFER INTO THE SOUTH SEA
4853-27671-0029 WHERE PERCHANCE I MIGHT MEET A WHALER OR A SOUTHSEAMAN FROM NEW HOLLAND BUT MY HEART SANK AT THE PROSPECT OF THE LEAGUES OF WATER WHICH ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND THE ISLANDS AND THE WESTERN AMERICAN SEABOARD INDEED
4853-27671-0030 I UNDERSTOOD THAT MY ONLY HOPE OF DELIVERANCE LAY IN BEING PICKED UP AND THAT THOUGH BY HEADING EAST I SHOULD BE CLINGING TO THE STORMY PARTS I WAS MORE LIKELY TO MEET WITH A SHIP HEREABOUTS
4853-27671-0031 THAN BY SAILING INTO THE GREAT DESOLATION OF THE NORTH WEST THE BURDEN OF MY LONELINESS WEIGHED DOWN UPON ME SO CRUSHINGLY THAT I CANNOT BUT CONSIDER MY SENSES MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT DULLED BY SUFFERING
4853-27671-0032 I AM PERSUADED MY HEART MUST HAVE BROKEN AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE DIED OF GRIEF FAINTLY AS THE WIND BLEW IT SPEEDILY WAFTED ME OUT OF SIGHT OF THE FLOATING RELICS OF THE WRECK
4853-27671-0033 AND THEN ALL WAS BARE BALD SWELLING SEA AND EMPEARLED SKY DARKENING IN LAGOONS OF AZURE DOWN TO THE SOFT MOUNTAINOUS MASSES OF WHITE VAPOUR LYING LIKE THE COAST OF A CONTINENT ON THE LARBOARD HORIZON
4853-27671-0034 BUT ONE LIVING THING THERE WAS BESIDES MYSELF A GREY BREASTED ALBATROSS OF A PRINCELY WIDTH OF PINION I HAD NOT OBSERVED IT TILL THE HULL WENT DOWN AND THEN
4853-27671-0035 LIFTING MY EYES WITH INVOLUNTARY SYMPATHY IN THE DIRECTION POINTED TO BY THE UPRAISED ARMS OF THE SAILOR I OBSERVED THE GREAT ROYAL BIRD HANGING LIKE A SHAPE OF MARBLE DIRECTLY OVER THE FROTHING EDDIES
4853-27671-0036 IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SPIRIT OF THE DEEP HAD TAKEN FORM IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NOBLEST OF ALL THE FOWLS OF ITS DOMINIONS AND POISED ON TREMORLESS WINGS
4853-27671-0037 WAS SURVEYING WITH THE COLD CURIOSITY OF AN INTELLIGENCE EMPTY OF HUMAN EMOTION THE DESTRUCTION OF ONE OF THOSE FABRICS WHOSE UNEQUAL CONTESTS AND REPEATED TRIUMPHS HAD PROVOKED ITS HAUGHTY SURPRISE
4853-27671-0038 THE BIRD QUITTED THE SPOT OF THE WRECK AFTER A WHILE AND FOLLOWED ME ITS EYES HAD THE SPARKLING BLOOD RED GLEAM OF RUBIES
4853-27671-0039 IT WAS AS SILENT AS A PHANTOM AND WITH ARCHED NECK AND MOTIONLESS PLUMES SEEMED TO WATCH ME WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT PRESENTLY GREW INSUFFERABLE SO FAR FROM FINDING ANY COMFORT OF COMPANIONSHIP IN THE CREATURE
4853-27671-0040 IT UTTERED A STRANGE SALT CRY THE VERY NOTE OF A GUST OF WIND SPLITTING UPON A ROPE FLAPPED ITS WINGS AND AFTER A TURN OR TWO
4853-29413-0000 GLOODY SETTLES THE ACCOUNT A NIGHT OF FEVER A NIGHT WHEN I DID SLUMBER FOR A FEW MINUTES OF HORRID DREAMS THIS WAS WHAT I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
4853-29413-0001 THE FRESH MORNING AIR FLOWING THROUGH MY OPEN WINDOW COOLED AND COMPOSED ME THE MERCY OF SLEEP FOUND ME WHEN I WOKE AND LOOKED AT MY WATCH I WAS A NEW MAN THE HOUR WAS NOON I RANG MY BELL
4853-29413-0002 THE SERVANT ANNOUNCED THAT A MAN WAS WAITING TO SEE ME THE SAME MAN SIR WHO WAS FOUND IN THE GARDEN LOOKING AT YOUR FLOWERS I AT ONCE GAVE DIRECTIONS TO HAVE HIM SHOWN UP INTO MY BEDROOM
4853-29413-0003 THE DELAY OF DRESSING WAS MORE THAN I HAD PATIENCE TO ENCOUNTER UNLESS I WAS COMPLETELY MISTAKEN HERE WAS THE VERY PERSON WHOM I WANTED TO ENLIGHTEN ME GLOODY SHOWED HIMSELF AT THE DOOR
4853-29413-0004 WITH A FACE OMINOUSLY WRETCHED AS WELL AS UGLY I INSTANTLY THOUGHT OF CRISTEL IF YOU BRING ME BAD NEWS I SAID DON'T KEEP ME WAITING FOR IT IT'S NOTHING THAT NEED TROUBLE YOU SIR
4853-29413-0005 I'M DISMISSED FROM MY MASTER'S SERVICE THAT'S ALL IT WAS PLAINLY NOT ALL RELIEVED EVEN BY THAT GUARDED REPLY I POINTED TO A CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I MEAN WELL BY YOU I ASKED
4853-29413-0006 WHAT DID HE DO FLEW INTO A FURIOUS RAGE I DON'T COMPLAIN OF THAT I DARESAY I DESERVED IT PLEASE TO EXCUSE MY GETTING UP AGAIN I CAN'T LOOK YOU IN THE FACE AND TELL YOU OF IT HE WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW
4853-29413-0007 EVEN A POOR DEVIL LIKE ME DOES SOMETIMES FEEL IT WHEN HE IS INSULTED MISTER ROYLAKE HE KICKED ME SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT SIR I WOULD NEVER HAVE MENTIONED IT IF I HADN'T HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU ONLY I DON'T KNOW HOW
4853-29413-0008 IN THIS DIFFICULTY HE CAME BACK TO MY BEDSIDE LOOK HERE SIR WHAT I SAY IS THAT KICK HAS WIPED OUT THE DEBT OF THANKS I OWE HIM YES I SAY THE ACCOUNT BETWEEN US TWO IS SETTLED NOW ON BOTH SIDES
4853-29413-0009 WHAT HIS MASTER HAD NO DOUBT INFERRED WAS WHAT I SAW PLAINLY TOO CRISTEL HAD SAVED MY LIFE AND HAD BEEN DIRECTED HOW TO DO IT BY THE POOR FELLOW WHO HAD SUFFERED IN MY CAUSE
4853-29413-0010 WE WILL WAIT A LITTLE BEFORE WE TALK OF SETTING THE LAW IN FORCE I SAID IN THE MEANTIME GLOODY I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD TELL THE MAGISTRATE IF I CALLED YOU AS A WITNESS HE CONSIDERED A LITTLE
4853-29413-0011 THE MAGISTRATE WOULD PUT QUESTIONS TO ME WOULDN'T HE SIR VERY GOOD YOU PUT QUESTIONS TO ME AND I'LL ANSWER THEM TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
4853-29413-0012 THE INVESTIGATION THAT FOLLOWED WAS FAR TOO LONG AND TOO WEARISOME TO BE RELATED HERE IF I GIVE THE SUBSTANCE OF IT I SHALL HAVE DONE ENOUGH SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS AWAKE AND SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS ALONE SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP AND DREAMING
4853-29413-0013 THE CUR HAD BETRAYED HIMSELF IT WAS A PALTRY VENGEANCE I OWN TO GRATIFY A MALICIOUS PLEASURE AS I DID NOW IN THINKING OF HIM AND SPEAKING OF HIM BY THE DEGRADING NAME WHICH HIS MORBID HUMILITY HAD SUGGESTED
4853-29413-0014 TO GIVE HIM SOME IDEA OF THE JEALOUS HATRED WITH WHICH THE CUR REGARDED ME HE HAD DONE HIS BEST TO WARN ME WITHOUT ACTUALLY BETRAYING THE MAN WHO HAD RESCUED HIM FROM STARVATION OR THE WORKHOUSE AND HE HAD FAILED
4853-29413-0015 BUT HIS RESOLUTION TO DO ME GOOD SERVICE IN RETURN FOR MY KINDNESS TO HIM FAR FROM BEING SHAKEN WAS CONFIRMED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN HIS MASTER RETURNED TO THE CHEMICAL STUDIES WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED
4853-29413-0016 GLOODY WAS EMPLOYED AS ASSISTANT TO THE EXTENT OF HIS LIMITED CAPACITY FOR MAKING HIMSELF USEFUL HE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT I WAS THE OBJECT OF ANY OF THE EXPERIMENTS UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE TEA PARTY
4853-29413-0017 A LAPSE OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FOLLOWED THE LAST DOSE WAS REPEATED AND THE DOG SOON SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN AS LIVELY AS EVER GLOODY WAS THEREUPON TOLD TO SET THE ANIMAL FREE AND WAS INFORMED AT THE SAME TIME
4853-29413-0018 THAT HE WOULD BE INSTANTLY DISMISSED IF HE MENTIONED TO ANY LIVING CREATURE WHAT HE HAD JUST SEEN BY WHAT PROCESS HE ARRIVED AT THE SUSPICION THAT MY SAFETY MIGHT BE THREATENED BY THE EXPERIMENT ON THE DOG HE WAS ENTIRELY UNABLE TO EXPLAIN
4853-29413-0019 IT WAS BORNE IN ON MY MIND SIR AND THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU HE SAID I DIDN'T DARE SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED ME OR IF YOU DID BELIEVE ME YOU MIGHT HAVE SENT FOR THE POLICE
4853-29413-0020 THE ONE WAY OF PUTTING A STOP TO MURDERING MISCHIEF IF MURDERING MISCHIEF IT MIGHT BE WAS TO TRUST MISS CRISTEL THAT SHE WAS FOND OF YOU I DON'T MEAN ANY OFFENCE SIR I PRETTY WELL GUESSED
4853-29413-0021 THAT SHE WAS TRUE AS STEEL AND NOT EASILY FRIGHTENED I DIDN'T NEED TO GUESS I KNEW IT GLOODY HAD DONE HIS BEST TO PREPARE CRISTEL FOR THE TERRIBLE CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAD DETERMINED TO REPOSE IN HER AND HAD NOT SUCCEEDED
4853-29413-0022 SHE WAS PLEDGED TO SECRECY UNDER PENALTY OF RUINING THE MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO SAVE ME AND TO HER PRESENCE OF MIND WAS TRUSTED THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF PRESERVING MY LIFE WHAT A SITUATION FOR A GIRL OF EIGHTEEN
4853-29413-0023 WHATEVER SHE SAW HIM DRINK SHE WAS TO INSIST ON YOUR DRINKING IT TOO YOU HEARD ME ASK LEAVE TO MAKE THE TEA YES WELL THAT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNALS AGREED ON BETWEEN US
4853-29413-0024 HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT DRINK THE WHOLE CONTENTS OF THE JUG YOU FORGET SIR THAT I HAD SEEN THE DOG REVIVED BY TWO DOSES GIVEN WITH A SPACE OF TIME BETWEEN THEM
4853-29413-0025 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THIS AFTER WHAT HE HAD ALREADY TOLD ME MY INTELLIGENCE BRIGHTENED A LITTLE AS I WENT ON AND YOUR ACCIDENT IN THE NEXT ROOM WAS PLANNED OF COURSE I SAID
4853-29413-0026 I SHOULD SAY NO JUDGING BY HIS LOOKS HE TURNED PALE WHEN HE FELT THE FLOOR SHAKEN BY YOUR FALL FOR ONCE IN A WAY HE WAS HONEST HONESTLY FRIGHTENED I NOTICED THE SAME THING SIR WHEN HE PICKED ME UP OFF THE FLOOR
4853-29413-0027 A MAN WHO CAN CHANGE HIS COMPLEXION AT WILL IS A MAN WE HAV'N'T HEARD OF YET MISTER ROYLAKE I HAD BEEN DRESSING FOR SOME TIME PAST LONGING TO SEE CRISTEL IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY
4853-29413-0028 IS THERE ANYTHING MORE I ASKED THAT I OUGHT TO KNOW ONLY ONE THING MISTER ROYLAKE THAT I CAN THINK OF GLOODY REPLIED I'M AFRAID IT'S MISS CRISTEL'S TURN NEXT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
4853-29413-0029 WHILE THE DEAF MAN LODGES AT THE COTTAGE HE MEANS MISCHIEF AND HIS EYE IS ON MISS CRISTEL EARLY THIS MORNING SIR I HAPPENED TO BE AT THE BOAT HOUSE SOMEBODY I LEAVE YOU TO GUESS WHO IT IS HAS STOLEN THE OARS
4853-29413-0030 I WAS DRESSED BY THIS TIME AND SO EAGER TO GET TO THE COTTAGE THAT I HAD ALREADY OPENED MY DOOR WHAT I HAD JUST HEARD BROUGHT ME BACK INTO THE ROOM AS A MATTER OF COURSE WE BOTH SUSPECTED THE SAME PERSON OF STEALING THE OARS
4853-29413-0031 HAD WE ANY PROOF TO JUSTIFY US GLOODY AT ONCE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE HAD NO PROOF I HAPPENED TO LOOK AT THE BOAT HE SAID AND I MISSED THE OARS OH YES I SEARCHED THE BOAT HOUSE NO OARS NO OARS
4853-29413-0032 AND NOTHING MORE THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN AND OUGHT TO TELL ME NOTHING SIR
4898-20016-0000 HASTENING TO BEGIN HIS WORK THE TOWN IS AN OLD FASHIONED ONE AND ALTHOUGH THE OBSERVANCE OF THE ANCIENT CHURCH FESTIVAL IS NO LONGER FROWNED UPON AS IN YEARS PAST YET IT HAS BEEN LITTLE REGARDED
4898-20016-0001 ESPECIALLY IN THE CHURCH OF WHICH NATHAN IS A MEMBER AS THE SADDLER MOUNTED THE STEPS OF HIS SHOP HE FELT THE BLOOD SO RUSH ALONG HIS LIMBS AND TINGLE IN HIS FINGERS
4898-20016-0002 THAT HE COULD NOT FORBEAR STANDING WITHOUT THE DOOR FOR A MOMENT AS IF TO ENJOY THE TRIUMPH OF THE WARMTH WITHIN HIM OVER THE COLD MORNING AIR THE LITTLE STONE CHURCH
4898-20016-0003 WHICH NATHAN ATTENDS STANDS IN THE SAME SQUARE WITH HIS SHOP AND NEARLY OPPOSITE IT WAS CLOSED AS USUAL ON CHRISTMAS DAY AND A RECENT SNOW HAD HEAPED THE STEPS AND ROOF AND LOADED THE WINDOWS
4898-20016-0004 NATHAN THOUGHT THAT IT LOOKED UNCOMMONLY BEAUTIFUL IN THE SOFTENING TWILIGHT OF THE MORNING WHILE NATHAN STOOD MUSING WITH HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE CHURCH
4898-20016-0005 ALTHOUGH A GOOD DEAL STOOPING WITH LONG STRAIGHT AND VERY WHITE HAIR FALLING OVER HIS SHOULDERS WHICH WAS THE MORE CONSPICUOUS FROM THE BLACK VELVET CAP AS IT APPEARED THAT HE WORE
4898-20016-0006 AS TO WHO THE STRANGER COULD BE WHEN HE BEHELD HIM TURN IN BETWEEN THE POSTS BY THE PATH THAT LEADS TO THE CHURCH TREAD LIGHTLY OVER THE SNOW AND UP THE STEPS AND KNOCK HASTILY AND VIGOROUSLY AT THE CHURCH DOOR
4898-20016-0007 BUT HALF RECOVERED FROM HIS WONDER HE WAS JUST RAISING HIS VOICE TO UTTER A REMONSTRANCE WHEN TO HIS SEVENFOLD AMAZEMENT THE DOOR WAS OPENED TO THE KNOCK AND THE OLD MAN DISAPPEARED WITHIN
4898-20016-0008 IT WAS NOT WITHOUT A CREEPING FEELING OF AWE MINGLED WITH HIS ASTONISHMENT THAT NATHAN GAZED UPON THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THIS SILENT FIGURE HAD VANISHED BUT HE WAS NOT EASILY TO BE DAUNTED
4898-20016-0009 HE DID NOT CARE TO FOLLOW THE STEPS OF THE STRANGER INTO THE CHURCH BUT HE REMEMBERED A SHED SO PLACED AGAINST THE BUILDING NEAR THE FARTHER END THAT HE HAD OFTEN WHEN A CHILD AT SOME PERIL INDEED CLIMBED UPON ITS TOP
4898-20016-0010 AND LOOKED INTO THE CHURCH THROUGH A LITTLE WINDOW AT ONE SIDE OF THE PULPIT FOR THIS HE STARTED BUT HE DID NOT FAIL TO RUN ACROSS THE SQUARE AND LEAP OVER THE CHURCH GATE AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED
4898-20016-0011 IN ORDER TO GATHER WARMTH AND COURAGE FOR THE ATTEMPT WHEN NATHAN STODDARD CLIMBED UPON THE OLD SHED AND PRESSED HIS FACE AGAINST THE GLASS OF THE LITTLE CHURCH WINDOW HE HAD AT FIRST ONLY A CONFUSED IMPRESSION
4898-20016-0012 AS HE GLARED THROUGH THE DARKNESS INTO THE OLD KIRK OF ALLOWAY THE GREAT CHANDELIER OF THE CHURCH WAS PARTLY LIGHTED AND THERE WERE BESIDES MANY CANDLES AND LANTERNS BURNING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROOM
4898-20016-0013 WHO WERE DRESSED IN BREECHES AND RUFFLED SHIRTS AND HOOPED PETTICOATS AND TOWERING HEAD DRESSES SUCH AS HE HAD ONLY SEEN IN OLD PICTURES THEY WERE MOUNTED UPON BENCHES AND LADDERS
4898-20016-0014 AND BOARDS LAID ALONG THE TOPS OF THE PEWS AND WERE APPARENTLY JUST COMPLETING THE DECORATION OF THE CHURCH WHICH WAS ALREADY DRESSED WITH GREEN WITH LITTLE TREES IN THE CORNERS AND WITH GREEN LETTERS UPON THE WALLS
4898-20016-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY APPEARED FULL OF LIFE AND CHEERFULNESS WHILE THE OLD MAN WHOM NATHAN HAD SEEN ENTER STOOD NEAR THE DOOR LOOKING QUIETLY ON WITH A LITTLE GIRL HOLDING HIS HAND
4898-20016-0016 IT WAS NOT UNTIL NATHAN STODDARD HAD LOOKED FOR SOME LITTLE TIME UPON THIS SPECTACLE THAT HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE WAS WITNESS OF ANY THING MORE THAN NATURAL THE WHOLE PARTY HAD SO HOME LIKE AN AIR
4898-20016-0017 THE MORE HE WAS FILLED FOR ALL THEIR APPEARANCE OF YOUTH AND THEIR SIMPLE MANNERS WITH A STRANGE SORT OF VENERATION THE SWEET AND CHEERFUL FACES OF THE YOUNG WOMEN SEEMED TO GROW AWFULLY CALM
4898-20016-0018 AND BEAUTIFUL AS THEY BROUGHT THEIR TASK TO A CLOSE AND THEIR FOREHEADS WITH THE HAIR BROUGHT BACK IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY TO BECOME MORE AND MORE SERENE AND HIGH THERE WAS A STRANGE BEAUTY TOO
4898-20016-0019 ABOUT THE OLD MAN'S FACE HE APPEARED TO NATHAN AS IF HE FELT THAT THE GROUP BEFORE HIM ONLY WAITED HIS COMMAND TO FADE AWAY IN THE MORNING LIGHT THAT STRUGGLED AMONG THE CANDLES BUT HE COULD NOT BEAR TO GIVE THE WORD
4898-20016-0020 AND SO THEY KEPT PLAYING WITH THE FESTOONS AND STEPPING ABOUT THE PEWS TO PLEASE HIM NATHAN FELT A COLD THRILL PARTLY FROM PLEASURE AND PARTLY FROM AWE RUNNING UP HIS BACK AND A STRONG PAIN ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD
4898-20016-0021 UNTIL HE FELT THAT HE WAS NEAR SWOONING AND LIKE TO FALL AND HE CLUNG DESPERATELY TO HIS HOLD WHEN THE FIT WAS OVER HE DARED VENTURE NO MORE BUT HASTENED TO THE GROUND
4898-20016-0022 THAT LED NATHAN STODDARD TO KEEP SECRET WHAT HE HAD WITNESSED BUT IT WAS LIKE SOME DEEP AND HOLY EXPERIENCE
4898-20016-0023 SO HE WENT BACK TO HIS SHOP AND SAT LOOKING UPON THE CHURCH AND WATCHING ALMOST WITH DREAD THE DOVES THAT LIGHTED UPON ITS ROOF AND FLUTTERED ABOUT AND BEAT THEIR WINGS AGAINST ITS WINDOWS
4898-20016-0024 THE MINISTER OF NATHAN'S PARISH WAS A YOUNG MAN BY THE NAME OF DUDLEY AND IT SO HAPPENED THAT HE HAD DRIVEN OUT BEFORE LIGHT ON THE MORNING WE HAVE SPOKEN OF TO VISIT A SICK MAN AT SOME DISTANCE
4898-20016-0025 IN RETURNING HOME HE HAD TO PASS ALONG THE RATHER UNFREQUENTED STREET WHICH RUNS IN THE REAR OF HIS CHURCH AND CLOSE TO IT AS HE WAS DRIVING RAPIDLY ALONG HIS EAR CAUGHT WHAT SEEMED THE PEAL OF AN ORGAN
4898-20016-0026 HE STOPPED HIS HORSE TO LISTEN
4898-20016-0027 AND DROVE ROUND INTO THE SQUARE TO THE SHOP OF NATHAN STODDARD THERE IS MUSIC TO DAY IN OUR CHURCH NATHAN HE CRIED TO THE YOUNG SADDLER WHAT CAN IT MEAN BUT NATHAN ANSWERED NOT A WORD HE CAUGHT THE HORSE BY THE HEAD
4898-20016-0028 AND FASTENED HIM TO A POST BEFORE THE DOOR THEN STEPPING TO THE SIDE OF THE SLEIGH HE SAID TO MISTER DUDLEY COME WITH ME SIR MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED UPON THE PALE FACE AND TREMBLING LIPS OF HIS PARISHIONER
4898-20016-0029 AND FOLLOWED IN SILENCE NATHAN SPRANG UPON THE SHED AT THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH AND SCRAMBLED UP TO THE LITTLE WINDOW MISTER DUDLEY FOLLOWED AND WITH NATHAN'S HELP GAINED THE SAME PRECARIOUS FOOTHOLD LOOK IN SIR
4898-20016-0030 SAID NATHAN NOT VENTURING A GLANCE HIMSELF MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED AND HAD NOT NATHAN'S ARM BEEN ABOUT HIS BODY HE WOULD HAVE LOST HIS HOLD IN SHEER AMAZEMENT THE BUILDING WAS CROWDED AS HE HAD NEVER KNOWN IT BEFORE
4898-20016-0031 AND CROWDED WITH PEOPLE WHOM HIS EYE VERSED IN THE DRESS AND MANNERS OF OUR FOREFATHERS RECOGNIZED AS THE CHURCH GOERS OF A CENTURY AND A HALF AGO THE SINGERS GALLERY WAS FILLED BY A CHOIR OF GIRLS AND BOYS
4898-20016-0032 IT WAS SAID TO BE A PORTRAIT OF A MINISTER IN THE TOWN WHO LIVED IN THE LAST CENTURY AND IS STILL REMEMBERED FOR HIS VIRTUES THE SIGHT OF THIS OLD MAN'S FACE COMPLETELY STILLED THE AGITATION OF THE YOUNG MINISTER
4898-20016-0033 HE WAS LEANING OVER THE GREAT BIBLE WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED UPON IT AND HIS EYES SEEMINGLY FILLED WITH TEARS OF PLEASURE AND GRATITUDE AND BENT UPON THE CHOIR MISTER DUDLEY LISTENED INTENTLY
