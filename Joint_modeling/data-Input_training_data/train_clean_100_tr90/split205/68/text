311-124404-0069 AND OF HAVING BEEN THE FIRST TO TEACH THAT THERE ARE MANY SMALL PASSAGES AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES THROUGH WHICH THE BLOOD RECEIVED BY THEM FROM THE HEART PASSES INTO THE SMALL BRANCHES OF THE VEINS
311-124404-0070 SO THAT ITS COURSE AMOUNTS PRECISELY TO A PERPETUAL CIRCULATION OF THIS WE HAVE ABUNDANT PROOF IN THE ORDINARY EXPERIENCE OF SURGEONS WHO BY BINDING THE ARM WITH A TIE OF MODERATE STRAITNESS ABOVE THE PART WHERE THEY OPEN THE VEIN
311-124404-0071 CAUSE THE BLOOD TO FLOW MORE COPIOUSLY THAN IT WOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT ANY LIGATURE WHEREAS QUITE THE CONTRARY WOULD HAPPEN WERE THEY TO BIND IT BELOW THAT IS BETWEEN THE HAND AND THE OPENING OR WERE TO MAKE THE LIGATURE ABOVE
311-124404-0072 THE OPENING VERY TIGHT FOR IT IS MANIFEST THAT THE TIE MODERATELY STRAIGHTENED WHILE ADEQUATE TO HINDER THE BLOOD ALREADY IN THE ARM FROM RETURNING TOWARDS THE HEART BY THE VEINS CANNOT ON THAT ACCOUNT PREVENT NEW BLOOD
311-124404-0073 FROM COMING FORWARD THROUGH THE ARTERIES BECAUSE THESE ARE SITUATED BELOW THE VEINS AND THEIR COVERINGS FROM THEIR GREATER CONSISTENCY ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO COMPRESS AND ALSO THAT THE BLOOD WHICH COMES FROM THE HEART TENDS TO PASS THROUGH THEM
311-124404-0074 TO THE HAND WITH GREATER FORCE THAN IT DOES TO RETURN FROM THE HAND TO THE HEART THROUGH THE VEINS AND SINCE THE LATTER CURRENT ESCAPES FROM THE ARM BY THE OPENING MADE IN ONE OF THE VEINS THERE MUST OF NECESSITY
311-124404-0075 WHICH IS IN THE BODY MAY FLOW OUT OF IT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THROUGH A SINGLE ARTERY THAT HAS BEEN CUT
311-124404-0076 SO AS TO PREVENT THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE BLOOD FLOWING OUT OF IT COULD COME FROM ANY OTHER QUARTER THAN THE HEART BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EVINCE THAT WHAT I HAVE ALLEGED
311-124404-0077 IS THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE MOTION OF THE BLOOD THUS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE BLOOD WHICH FLOWS FROM THE VEINS AND THAT FROM THE ARTERIES CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THIS
311-124404-0078 AND MORE VIVID AND WARMER IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE HEART IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IN THE ARTERIES THAN IT WAS A SHORT TIME BEFORE PASSING INTO EITHER IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IT WAS IN THE VEINS
311-124404-0079 AND IF ATTENTION BE GIVEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HEART
311-124404-0080 IN PARTS MORE REMOTE FROM IT IN THE NEXT PLACE
311-124404-0081 SUFFICIENTLY SHOWS THAT THE BLOOD IS IMPELLED AGAINST THEM WITH MORE FORCE THAN AGAINST THE VEINS AND WHY SHOULD THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART
311-124404-0082 AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN WERE IT NOT THAT THE BLOOD OF THE VENOUS ARTERY HAVING ONLY BEEN IN THE LUNGS AFTER IT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE HEART IS THINNER AND RAREFIES MORE READILY AND IN A HIGHER DEGREE
311-124404-0083 WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF THE BLOOD BE WITHDRAWN FROM ANY PART THE HEAT IS LIKEWISE WITHDRAWN BY THE SAME MEANS AND ALTHOUGH THE HEART WERE AS HOT AS GLOWING IRON IT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF WARMING THE FEET AND HANDS
311-124404-0084 AND THAT IN CHILDREN WHO CANNOT USE THEM WHILE IN THE WOMB
311-124404-0085 WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IT IS DISTILLED BY PASSING AND REPASSING THROUGH THE HEART PERHAPS MORE THAN ONE OR TWO HUNDRED TIMES IN A DAY
311-124404-0086 AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE DIFFERENT HUMORS OF THE BODY BEYOND SAYING THAT THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE BLOOD IN BEING RAREFIED PASSES FROM THE HEART TOWARDS THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES CAUSES CERTAIN OF ITS PARTS TO REMAIN IN THE MEMBERS AT WHICH THEY ARRIVE
311-124404-0087 AND THERE OCCUPY THE PLACE OF SOME OTHERS EXPELLED BY THEM AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION SHAPE OR SMALLNESS OF THE PORES WITH WHICH THEY MEET SOME RATHER THAN OTHERS FLOW INTO CERTAIN PARTS
311-124404-0088 WHICH BY BEING VARIOUSLY PERFORATED SERVE TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF GRAIN AND IN THE LAST PLACE WHAT ABOVE ALL IS HERE WORTHY OF OBSERVATION
311-124404-0089 IS THE GENERATION OF THE ANIMAL SPIRITS WHICH ARE LIKE A VERY SUBTLE WIND OR RATHER A VERY PURE AND VIVID FLAME WHICH
311-124404-0090 ASCENDING IN GREAT ABUNDANCE FROM THE HEART TO THE BRAIN THENCE PENETRATES THROUGH THE NERVES INTO THE MUSCLES AND GIVES MOTION TO ALL THE MEMBERS SO THAT TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE BLOOD WHICH AS MOST AGITATED AND PENETRATING
311-124404-0091 PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BRAIN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN SIMPLY THAT THE ARTERIES WHICH CARRY THEM THITHER PROCEED FROM THE HEART
311-124404-0092 IN THE MOST DIRECT LINES AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MECHANICS WHICH ARE THE SAME WITH THOSE OF NATURE WHEN MANY OBJECTS TEND AT ONCE TO THE SAME POINT
311-124404-0093 WHICH FLOW FORTH FROM THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART AND TEND TOWARDS THE BRAIN THE WEAKER AND LESS AGITATED PARTS MUST NECESSARILY BE DRIVEN ASIDE FROM THAT POINT BY THE STRONGER WHICH ALONE IN THIS WAY REACH IT
311-124404-0094 I HAD EXPOUNDED ALL THESE MATTERS WITH SUFFICIENT MINUTENESS IN THE TREATISE WHICH I FORMERLY THOUGHT OF PUBLISHING AND AFTER THESE I HAD SHOWN WHAT MUST BE THE FABRIC OF THE NERVES AND MUSCLES OF THE HUMAN BODY
311-124404-0095 TO GIVE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS CONTAINED IN IT THE POWER TO MOVE THE MEMBERS AS WHEN WE SEE HEADS SHORTLY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK OFF STILL MOVE AND BITE THE EARTH ALTHOUGH NO LONGER ANIMATED WHAT CHANGES MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE BRAIN TO PRODUCE
311-124404-0096 WAKING SLEEP AND DREAMS HOW LIGHT SOUNDS ODORS TASTES HEAT AND ALL THE OTHER QUALITIES OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS IMPRESS IT WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS BY MEANS OF THE SENSES HOW HUNGER
311-124404-0097 THIRST AND THE OTHER INTERNAL AFFECTIONS CAN LIKEWISE IMPRESS UPON IT DIVERS IDEAS WHAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE COMMON SENSE SENSUS COMMUNIS IN WHICH THESE IDEAS ARE RECEIVED BY THE MEMORY WHICH RETAINS THEM
311-124404-0098 BY THE FANTASY WHICH CAN CHANGE THEM IN VARIOUS WAYS AND OUT OF THEM COMPOSE NEW IDEAS AND WHICH BY THE SAME MEANS DISTRIBUTING THE ANIMAL SPIRITS THROUGH THE MUSCLES CAN CAUSE THE MEMBERS OF SUCH A BODY TO MOVE IN AS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
311-124404-0099 TO THOSE WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE VARIETY OF MOVEMENTS PERFORMED BY THE DIFFERENT AUTOMATA OR MOVING MACHINES FABRICATED BY HUMAN INDUSTRY AND THAT WITH HELP OF BUT FEW PIECES COMPARED WITH THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF BONES
311-124404-0100 MUSCLES NERVES ARTERIES VEINS AND OTHER PARTS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE BODY OF EACH ANIMAL SUCH PERSONS WILL LOOK UPON THIS BODY AS A MACHINE MADE BY THE HANDS OF GOD WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER ARRANGED
311-124404-0101 AND ADEQUATE TO MOVEMENTS MORE ADMIRABLE THAN IS ANY MACHINE OF HUMAN INVENTION AND HERE I SPECIALLY STAYED TO SHOW THAT WERE THERE SUCH MACHINES EXACTLY RESEMBLING ORGANS AND OUTWARD FORM AN APE OR ANY OTHER IRRATIONAL ANIMAL
311-124404-0102 WE COULD HAVE NO MEANS OF KNOWING THAT THEY WERE IN ANY RESPECT OF A DIFFERENT NATURE FROM THESE ANIMALS BUT IF THERE WERE MACHINES BEARING THE IMAGE OF OUR BODIES AND CAPABLE OF IMITATING OUR ACTIONS AS FAR AS IT IS MORALLY POSSIBLE
311-124404-0103 OUR THOUGHTS TO OTHERS FOR WE MAY EASILY CONCEIVE A MACHINE TO BE SO CONSTRUCTED THAT IT EMITS VOCABLES AND EVEN THAT IT EMITS SOME CORRESPONDENT TO THE ACTION UPON IT OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS WHICH CAUSE A CHANGE IN ITS ORGANS
311-124404-0104 FOR EXAMPLE IF TOUCHED IN A PARTICULAR PLACE IT MAY DEMAND WHAT WE WISH TO SAY TO IT IF IN ANOTHER IT MAY CRY OUT THAT IT IS HURT AND SUCH LIKE
311-124404-0105 APPOSITELY TO REPLY TO WHAT IS SAID IN ITS PRESENCE AS MEN OF THE LOWEST GRADE OF INTELLECT CAN DO THE SECOND TEST IS THAT ALTHOUGH SUCH MACHINES MIGHT EXECUTE MANY THINGS WITH EQUAL OR PERHAPS GREATER PERFECTION THAN ANY OF US
311-124404-0106 THESE ORGANS ON THE CONTRARY NEED A PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR ACTION WHENCE IT MUST BE MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD EXIST IN ANY MACHINE A DIVERSITY OF ORGANS SUFFICIENT
311-124404-0107 THAT THERE ARE NO MEN SO DULL AND STUPID NOT EVEN IDIOTS AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF JOINING TOGETHER DIFFERENT WORDS AND THEREBY CONSTRUCTING A DECLARATION BY WHICH TO MAKE THEIR THOUGHTS UNDERSTOOD
311-124404-0108 DESTITUTE OF THE ORGANS WHICH OTHERS USE IN SPEAKING ARE IN THE HABIT OF SPONTANEOUSLY INVENTING CERTAIN SIGNS BY WHICH THEY DISCOVER THEIR THOUGHTS TO THOSE WHO BEING USUALLY IN THEIR COMPANY HAVE LEISURE TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE
311-124404-0109 AND THIS PROVES NOT ONLY THAT THE BRUTES HAVE LESS REASON THAN MAN BUT THAT THEY HAVE NONE AT ALL FOR WE SEE THAT VERY LITTLE IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE A PERSON TO SPEAK
311-124404-0110 AND SINCE A CERTAIN INEQUALITY OF CAPACITY IS OBSERVABLE AMONG ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS WELL AS AMONG MEN AND SINCE SOME ARE MORE CAPABLE OF BEING INSTRUCTED THAN OTHERS IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE MOST PERFECT APE OR PARROT OF ITS SPECIES
311-124404-0111 SHOULD NOT IN THIS BE EQUAL TO THE MOST STUPID INFANT OF ITS KIND OR AT LEAST TO ONE THAT WAS CRACK BRAINED UNLESS THE SOUL OF BRUTES
311-124404-0112 AND WE OUGHT NOT TO CONFOUND SPEECH WITH THE NATURAL MOVEMENTS WHICH INDICATE THE PASSIONS AND CAN BE IMITATED BY MACHINES AS WELL AS MANIFESTED BY ANIMALS NOR MUST IT BE THOUGHT WITH CERTAIN OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE BRUTES SPEAK ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE
311-124404-0113 SINCE THEY ARE ENDOWED WITH MANY ORGANS ANALOGOUS TO OURS THEY COULD AS EASILY COMMUNICATE THEIR THOUGHTS TO US AS TO THEIR FELLOWS
311-124404-0114 THAT THOUGH THERE ARE MANY ANIMALS WHICH MANIFEST MORE INDUSTRY THAN WE IN CERTAIN OF THEIR ACTIONS THE SAME ANIMALS ARE YET OBSERVED TO SHOW NONE AT ALL IN MANY OTHERS SO THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY DO BETTER
311-124404-0115 AND COULD SURPASS US IN ALL THINGS ON THE CONTRARY IT RATHER PROVES THAT THEY ARE DESTITUTE OF REASON AND THAT IT IS NATURE WHICH ACTS IN THEM ACCORDING TO THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR ORGANS THUS IT IS SEEN THAT A CLOCK COMPOSED ONLY OF WHEELS AND WEIGHTS
311-124404-0116 CAN NUMBER THE HOURS AND MEASURE TIME MORE EXACTLY THAN WE WITH ALL OUR SKIN I HAD AFTER THIS DESCRIBED THE REASONABLE SOUL AND SHOWN THAT IT COULD BY NO MEANS BE EDUCED FROM THE POWER OF MATTER
311-124404-0117 AS THE OTHER THINGS OF WHICH I HAD SPOKEN BUT THAT IT MUST BE EXPRESSLY CREATED AND THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT IT BE LODGED IN THE HUMAN BODY EXACTLY LIKE A PILOT IN A SHIP UNLESS PERHAPS TO MOVE ITS MEMBERS
311-124404-0118 BUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE JOINED AND UNITED MORE CLOSELY TO THE BODY IN ORDER TO HAVE SENSATIONS AND APPETITES SIMILAR TO OURS AND THUS CONSTITUTE A REAL MAN
311-124404-0119 THERE IS NONE THAT IS MORE POWERFUL IN LEADING FEEBLE MINDS ASTRAY FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH OF VIRTUE
311-124404-0120 AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT AFTER THIS LIFE WE HAVE NOTHING TO HOPE FOR OR FEAR MORE THAN FLIES AND ANTS IN PLACE OF WHICH WHEN WE KNOW HOW FAR THEY DIFFER WE MUCH BETTER COMPREHEND THE REASONS WHICH ESTABLISH
311-124404-0121 BECAUSE NO OTHER CAUSES ARE OBSERVED CAPABLE OF DESTROYING IT
3112-9554-0000 HE DID NOT SPEAK ABOUT IT AT LENGTH BUT SAID THAT HE HAD WRITTEN ME A LETTER NOT TO BE OPENED UNTIL AFTER HIS DEATH CONTAINING INSTRUCTIONS FOR PUBLICATION THIS LETTER WAS DATED THIRTIETH APRIL
3112-9554-0001 EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX I WILL GIVE HERE AS MUCH OF IT AS CONCERNS THE PUBLIC I WISH YOU TO ACCEPT AS A GIFT FROM ME GIVEN YOU NOW THE ACCOMPANYING PAGES WHICH CONTAIN A MEMOIR OF MY LIFE
3112-9554-0002 MY INTENTION IS THAT THEY SHALL BE PUBLISHED AFTER MY DEATH AND BE EDITED BY YOU BUT I LEAVE IT ALTOGETHER TO YOUR DISCRETION WHETHER TO PUBLISH OR TO SUPPRESS THE WORK AND ALSO TO YOUR DISCRETION WHETHER ANY PART OR WHAT PART SHALL BE OMITTED
3112-9554-0003 BUT I WOULD NOT WISH THAT ANYTHING SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE MEMOIR IF YOU WISH TO SAY ANY WORD AS FROM YOURSELF LET IT BE DONE IN THE SHAPE OF A PREFACE OR INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER AT THE END THERE IS A POSTSCRIPT
3112-9554-0004 THE PUBLICATION IF MADE AT ALL SHOULD BE EFFECTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER MY DEATH MY FATHER DIED ON THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO IT WILL BE SEEN THEREFORE
3112-9554-0005 THAT MY DUTY HAS BEEN MERELY TO PASS THE BOOK THROUGH THE PRESS CONFORMABLY TO THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS I HAVE PLACED HEADINGS TO THE RIGHT HAND PAGES THROUGHOUT THE BOOK AND I DO NOT CONCEIVE THAT I WAS PRECLUDED FROM SO DOING
3112-9554-0006 THAT HE HAD GIVEN UP HUNTING BUT HE STILL KEPT TWO HORSES FOR SUCH RIDING AS MAY BE HAD IN OR ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF LONDON HE CONTINUED TO RIDE TO THE END OF HIS LIFE HE LIKED THE EXERCISE AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE DISTRESSED HIM NOT TO HAVE HAD A HORSE IN HIS STABLE
3112-9554-0007 BUT HE NEVER SPOKE WILLINGLY ON HUNTING MATTERS HE HAD AT LAST RESOLVED TO GIVE UP HIS FAVOURITE AMUSEMENT AND THAT AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED THERE SHOULD BE AN END OF IT IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HE WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA
3112-9554-0008 THE JOURNEY LASTED ALTOGETHER SIXTEEN DAYS AND DURING THAT TIME MISTER AND MISSUS BURNS WERE THE HOSPITABLE ENTERTAINERS WHEN MY FATHER RETURNED HE WROTE A SHORT ACCOUNT OF HOW THE MASTIFFS WENT TO ICELAND
3112-9554-0009 THE BOOK WAS PRINTED BUT WAS INTENDED ONLY FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION EVERY DAY UNTIL HIS LAST ILLNESS MY FATHER CONTINUED HIS WORK HE WOULD NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN HAPPY
3112-9554-0010 HE DEMANDED FROM HIMSELF LESS THAN HE HAD DONE TEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY BUT HIS DAILY TASK WAS ALWAYS DONE I WILL MENTION NOW THE TITLES OF HIS BOOKS THAT WERE PUBLISHED AFTER THE LAST INCLUDED IN THE LIST WHICH HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN AT THE END OF THE SECOND VOLUME
3112-9554-0011 AN EYE FOR AN EYE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE COUSIN HENRY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THACKERAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE DUKE'S CHILDREN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY LIFE OF CICERO
3112-9554-0012 EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AYALA'S ANGEL EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE DOCTOR WORTLE'S SCHOOL EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE FRAU FROHMANN AND OTHER STORIES EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO
3112-9554-0013 AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH HE HAD WRITTEN FOUR FIFTHS OF AN IRISH STORY CALLED THE LANDLEAGUERS SHORTLY ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED AND HE LEFT IN MANUSCRIPT A COMPLETED NOVEL CALLED AN OLD MAN'S LOVE
3112-9554-0014 WHICH WILL BE PUBLISHED BY MESSRS BLACKWOOD AND SONS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY MY FATHER LEFT LONDON AND WENT TO LIVE AT HARTING A VILLAGE IN SUSSEX BUT ON THE CONFINES OF HAMPSHIRE
3112-9554-0015 I THINK HE CHOSE THAT SPOT BECAUSE HE FOUND THERE A HOUSE THAT SUITED HIM AND BECAUSE OF THE PRETTINESS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HIS LAST LONG JOURNEY WAS A TRIP TO ITALY IN THE LATE WINTER AND SPRING OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE
3112-9554-0016 BUT HE WENT TO IRELAND TWICE IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO HE WENT THERE IN MAY OF THAT YEAR AND WAS THEN ABSENT NEARLY A MONTH THIS JOURNEY DID HIM MUCH GOOD FOR HE FOUND THAT THE SOFTER ATMOSPHERE RELIEVED HIS ASTHMA
3112-9554-0017 FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUFFERING FOR NEARLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN AUGUST FOLLOWING HE MADE ANOTHER TRIP TO IRELAND BUT FROM THIS JOURNEY HE DERIVED LESS BENEFIT HE WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN AND WAS VERY MUCH DISTRESSED BY THE UNHAPPY CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY
3112-9554-0018 FEW MEN KNEW IRELAND BETTER THAN HE DID HE HAD LIVED THERE FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND HIS POST OFFICE WORK HAD TAKEN HIM INTO EVERY PART OF THE ISLAND IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO HE BEGAN HIS LAST NOVEL
3112-9554-0019 THE LANDLEAGUERS WHICH AS STATED ABOVE WAS UNFINISHED WHEN HE DIED THIS BOOK WAS A CAUSE OF ANXIETY TO HIM HE COULD NOT RID HIS MIND OF THE FACT THAT HE HAD A STORY ALREADY IN THE COURSE OF PUBLICATION BUT WHICH HE HAD NOT YET COMPLETED
3112-9554-0020 IN NO OTHER CASE EXCEPT FRAMLEY PARSONAGE DID MY FATHER PUBLISH EVEN THE FIRST NUMBER OF ANY NOVEL BEFORE HE HAD FULLY COMPLETED THE WHOLE TALE
3112-9554-0021 HE WAS SEIZED WITH PARALYSIS ON THE RIGHT SIDE ACCOMPANIED BY LOSS OF SPEECH
3112-9554-0022 NEARLY FIVE WEEKS FROM THE NIGHT OF HIS ATTACK I HAVE BEEN LED TO SAY THESE FEW WORDS NOT AT ALL FROM A DESIRE TO SUPPLEMENT MY FATHER'S BIOGRAPHY OF HIMSELF BUT TO MENTION THE MAIN INCIDENTS IN HIS LIFE AFTER HE HAD FINISHED HIS OWN RECORD
3112-9554-0023 IN WHAT I HAVE HERE SAID I DO NOT THINK I HAVE EXCEEDED HIS INSTRUCTIONS
3112-9555-0000 CHAPTER ONE MY EDUCATION
3112-9555-0001 OF SO INSIGNIFICANT A PERSON AS MYSELF IT WILL NOT BE SO MUCH MY INTENTION TO SPEAK OF THE LITTLE DETAILS OF MY PRIVATE LIFE AS OF WHAT I AND PERHAPS OTHERS ROUND ME HAVE DONE IN LITERATURE
3112-9555-0002 OF MY FAILURES AND SUCCESSES SUCH AS THEY HAVE BEEN AND THEIR CAUSES AND OF THE OPENING WHICH A LITERARY CAREER OFFERS TO MEN AND WOMEN FOR THE EARNING OF THEIR BREAD
3112-9555-0003 AND YET THE GARRULITY OF OLD AGE AND THE APTITUDE OF A MAN'S MIND TO RECUR TO THE PASSAGES OF HIS OWN LIFE WILL I KNOW TEMPT ME TO SAY SOMETHING OF MYSELF
3112-9555-0004 NOR WITHOUT DOING SO SHOULD I KNOW HOW TO THROW MY MATTER INTO ANY RECOGNISED AND INTELLIGIBLE FORM THAT I OR ANY MAN SHOULD TELL EVERYTHING OF HIMSELF I HOLD TO BE IMPOSSIBLE
3112-9555-0005 I WILL SET DOWN NAUGHT IN MALICE NOR WILL I GIVE TO MYSELF OR OTHERS HONOUR WHICH I DO NOT BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN FAIRLY WON MY BOYHOOD WAS I THINK AS UNHAPPY AS THAT OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN COULD WELL BE
3112-9555-0006 MY MISFORTUNES ARISING FROM A MIXTURE OF POVERTY AND GENTLE STANDING ON THE PART OF MY FATHER
3112-9555-0007 I WAS BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN IN KEPPEL STREET RUSSELL SQUARE AND WHILE A BABY WAS CARRIED DOWN TO HARROW WHERE MY FATHER HAD BUILT A HOUSE ON A LARGE FARM
3112-9555-0008 AND PERHAPS THE DIRECTOR OF HER DESTINY AND OF OURS MY FATHER HAD BEEN A WYKAMIST AND A FELLOW OF NEW COLLEGE AND WINCHESTER WAS THE DESTINATION OF MY BROTHERS AND MYSELF
3112-9555-0009 AND SENT THREE OF US THERE ONE AFTER THE OTHER AT THE AGE OF SEVEN MY FATHER AT THIS TIME WAS A CHANCERY BARRISTER PRACTISING IN LONDON
3112-9555-0010 CHAMBERS WHICH ON ONE MELANCHOLY OCCASION DID BECOME ABSOLUTELY SUICIDAL
3112-9555-0011 IN HIS EARLY DAYS HE WAS A MAN OF SOME SMALL FORTUNE AND OF HIGHER HOPES THESE STOOD SO HIGH AT THE TIME OF MY BIRTH THAT HE WAS FELT TO BE ENTITLED TO A COUNTRY HOUSE AS WELL AS TO THAT IN KEPPEL STREET
3112-9555-0012 THIS PLACE HE CALLED JULIANS AND THE LAND RUNS UP TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL ON WHICH THE SCHOOL AND CHURCH STAND ON THE SIDE TOWARDS LONDON THINGS THERE WENT MUCH AGAINST HIM THE FARM WAS RUINOUS
3112-9555-0013 BUT AT ANY RATE AS OTHER DAY BOARDERS I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THEY WERE WELL TREATED BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO THE IGNOMINY WHICH I ENDURED
3112-9555-0014 I WAS ONLY SEVEN AND I THINK THAT BOYS AT SEVEN ARE NOW SPARED AMONG THEIR MORE CONSIDERATE SENIORS I WAS NEVER SPARED AND WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO RUN TO AND FRO BETWEEN OUR HOUSE AND THE SCHOOL
3112-9555-0015 WITHOUT A DAILY PURGATORY NO DOUBT MY APPEARANCE WAS AGAINST ME I REMEMBER WELL WHEN I WAS STILL THE JUNIOR BOY IN THE SCHOOL DOCTOR BUTLER THE HEAD MASTER STOPPING ME IN THE STREET AND ASKING ME
3112-9555-0016 PERHAPS HE DID NOT RECOGNISE ME BY MY FACE AT THIS TIME I WAS THREE YEARS AT HARROW AND AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER I WAS THE JUNIOR BOY IN THE SCHOOL WHEN I LEFT IT
3112-9555-0017 THEN I WAS SENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL AT SUNBURY KEPT BY ARTHUR DRURY THIS I THINK MUST HAVE BEEN DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADVICE OF HENRY DRURY WHO WAS MY TUTOR AT HARROW SCHOOL AND MY FATHER'S FRIEND
3112-9555-0018 WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO VISIT THE PLAYGROUND TILL THE SERMON WAS FINISHED MINE WAS ONLY DONE A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS MISSUS DRURY WHEN SHE SAW US SHOOK HER HEAD WITH PITYING HORROR
3112-9555-0019 THERE WERE EVER SO MANY OTHER PUNISHMENTS ACCUMULATED ON OUR HEADS IT BROKE MY HEART KNOWING MYSELF TO BE INNOCENT AND SUFFERING ALSO UNDER THE ALMOST EQUALLY PAINFUL FEELING THAT THE OTHER THREE NO DOUBT WICKED BOYS
3112-9555-0020 MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO BE THE LEADER OF WICKEDNESS ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEXT TERM HE WHISPERED TO ME HALF A WORD THAT PERHAPS HE HAD BEEN WRONG WITH ALL A STUPID BOY'S SLOWNESS I SAID NOTHING
3112-9555-0021 AND HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO CARRY REPARATION FURTHER ALL THAT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO AND IT BURNS ME NOW AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY WHAT LILY LIVERED CURS THOSE BOYS MUST HAVE BEEN NOT TO HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH
3112-9555-0022 AT ANY RATE AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED I REMEMBER THEIR NAMES WELL AND ALMOST WISH TO WRITE THEM HERE WHEN I WAS TWELVE THERE CAME THE VACANCY AT WINCHESTER COLLEGE WHICH I WAS DESTINED TO FILL
