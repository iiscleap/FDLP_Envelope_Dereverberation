1553-140048-0002 THOUGH NEITHER OF THEM ASCRIBED EITHER SUCCESS OR DEFEAT TO ANYTHING BUT THE IMPERIOUS FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES HOUSEWIVES LOOKED AT EMMA JANE AND DESIRED NO SOAP LISTENED TO HER DESCRIPTION OF ITS MERITS AND STILL DESIRED NONE
1553-140048-0003 OTHER STARS IN THEIR COURSES GOVERNED REBECCA'S DOINGS THE PEOPLE WHOM SHE INTERVIEWED EITHER REMEMBERED THEIR PRESENT NEED OF SOAP OR REMINDED THEMSELVES THAT THEY WOULD NEED IT IN THE FUTURE THE NOTABLE POINT IN THE CASE BEING
1553-140048-0004 THAT LUCKY REBECCA ACCOMPLISHED WITH ALMOST NO EFFORT RESULTS THAT POOR LITTLE EMMA JANE FAILED TO ATTAIN BY HARD AND CONSCIENTIOUS LABOR IT'S YOUR TURN REBECCA AND I'M GLAD TOO SAID EMMA JANE

1553-140048-0007 REBECCA WALKED UP THE LANE AND WENT TO THE SIDE DOOR THERE WAS A PORCH THERE AND SEATED IN A ROCKING CHAIR HUSKING CORN WAS A GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN OR WAS HE MIDDLE AGED REBECCA COULD NOT MAKE UP HER MIND
1553-140048-0008 AT ALL EVENTS HE HAD AN AIR OF THE CITY ABOUT HIM WELL SHAVEN FACE WELL TRIMMED MUSTACHE WELL FITTING CLOTHES REBECCA WAS A TRIFLE SHY AT THIS UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT EXPLAIN HER PRESENCE

1553-140048-0013 WISE CHILD THIS WAS GREAT GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND A CUSTOMER WHO KNEW ALL THE VIRTUES OF THE ARTICLE IN ADVANCE REBECCA DIMPLED MORE AND MORE AND AT HER NEW FRIEND'S INVITATION SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT HIS SIDE NEAR THE EDGE OF THE PORCH
1553-140048-0014 AND THE PRICES OF BOTH THAT AND THE SNOW WHITE WERE UNFOLDED PRESENTLY SHE FORGOT ALL ABOUT HER SILENT PARTNER AT THE GATE AND WAS TALKING AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN THIS GRAND PERSONAGE ALL HER LIFE
1553-140048-0015 I'M KEEPING HOUSE TO DAY BUT I DON'T LIVE HERE EXPLAINED THE DELIGHTFUL GENTLEMAN I'M JUST ON A VISIT TO MY AUNT WHO HAS GONE TO PORTLAND I USED TO BE HERE AS A BOY AND I AM VERY FOND OF THE SPOT
1553-140048-0016 I DON'T THINK ANYTHING TAKES THE PLACE OF THE FARM WHERE ONE LIVED WHEN ONE WAS A CHILD OBSERVED REBECCA NEARLY BURSTING WITH PRIDE AT HAVING AT LAST SUCCESSFULLY USED THE INDEFINITE PRONOUN IN GENERAL CONVERSATION
1553-140048-0017 SO YOU CONSIDER YOUR CHILDHOOD A THING OF THE PAST DO YOU YOUNG LADY I CAN STILL REMEMBER IT ANSWERED REBECCA GRAVELY THOUGH IT SEEMS A LONG TIME AGO

1553-140048-0022 I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID REBECCA CONSCIENTIOUSLY BUT I'LL LOOK IN THE CIRCULAR IT'S SURE TO TELL AND SHE DREW THE DOCUMENT FROM HER POCKET WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE MAGNIFICENT PROFITS YOU GET FROM THIS BUSINESS
1553-140048-0023 WE ARE NOT SELLING FOR OUR OWN BENEFIT SAID REBECCA CONFIDENTIALLY MY FRIEND WHO IS HOLDING THE HORSE AT THE GATE IS THE DAUGHTER OF A VERY RICH BLACKSMITH AND DOESN'T NEED ANY MONEY
1553-140048-0024 WE ARE TRYING TO GET A PREMIUM FOR SOME FRIENDS OF OURS REBECCA HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF ALLUDING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH HER PREVIOUS CUSTOMERS BUT UNEXPECTEDLY SHE FOUND HERSELF DESCRIBING MISTER SIMPSON MISSUS SIMPSON AND THE SIMPSON FAMILY
1553-140048-0025 THEIR POVERTY THEIR JOYLESS LIFE AND THEIR ABJECT NEED OF A BANQUET LAMP TO BRIGHTEN THEIR EXISTENCE YOU NEEDN'T ARGUE THAT POINT LAUGHED THE MAN AS HE STOOD UP TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE RICH BLACKSMITH'S DAUGHTER AT THE GATE

1553-140048-0027 IF THEY SELL TWO HUNDRED MORE CAKES THIS MONTH AND NEXT THEY CAN HAVE THE LAMP BY CHRISTMAS REBECCA ANSWERED AND THEY CAN GET A SHADE BY SUMMER TIME BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HELP VERY MUCH AFTER TO DAY BECAUSE MY AUNT MIRANDA MAY NOT LIKE TO HAVE ME
1553-140048-0028 I SEE WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT I'LL TAKE THREE HUNDRED CAKES AND THAT WILL GIVE THEM SHADE AND ALL
1553-140048-0029 TIPPED OVER AND DISAPPEARED INTO A CLUMP OF LILAC BUSHES IT WAS A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FORTUNATELY AND THE AMUSED CAPITALIST PICKED HER UP SET HER ON HER FEET AND BRUSHED HER OFF YOU SHOULD NEVER SEEM SURPRISED WHEN YOU HAVE TAKEN A LARGE ORDER SAID HE
1553-140048-0030 YOU OUGHT TO HAVE REPLIED CAN'T YOU MAKE IT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY INSTEAD OF CAPSIZING IN THAT UNBUSINESSLIKE WAY OH I COULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT EXCLAIMED REBECCA WHO WAS BLUSHING CRIMSON AT HER AWKWARD FALL

1553-140048-0038 IT WOULD BE RATHER A NICE SURPRISE TO HAVE THE LAMP ARRIVE AT THE SIMPSONS ON THANKSGIVING DAY WOULDN'T IT HE ASKED AS HE TUCKED THE OLD LAP ROBE COSILY OVER THEIR FEET
1553-140048-0039 OH DON'T MENTION IT LAUGHED MISTER ALADDIN LIFTING HIS HAT I WAS A SORT OF COMMERCIAL TRAVELER MYSELF ONCE YEARS AGO AND I LIKE TO SEE THE THING WELL DONE GOOD BY MISS REBECCA ROWENA

1553-140048-0042 IN AN ECSTASY OF REMINISCENCE OH ISN'T HE PERFECTLY ELERGANT AND WASN'T IT LOVELY OF HIM TO BUY US OUT AND JUST THINK OF HAVING BOTH THE LAMP AND THE SHADE FOR ONE DAY'S WORK AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU WORE YOUR PINK GINGHAM NOW
1553-140048-0043 EVEN IF MOTHER DID MAKE YOU PUT ON FLANNEL UNDERNEATH YOU DO LOOK SO PRETTY IN PINK AND RED REBECCA AND SO HOMELY IN DRAB AND BROWN I KNOW IT SIGHED REBECCA I WISH I WAS LIKE YOU PRETTY IN ALL COLORS
1553-140048-0044 AND REBECCA LOOKED LONGINGLY AT EMMA JANE'S FAT ROSY CHEEKS AT HER BLUE EYES WHICH SAID NOTHING AT HER NEAT NOSE WHICH HAD NO CHARACTER AT HER RED LIPS FROM BETWEEN WHICH NO WORD WORTH LISTENING TO HAD EVER ISSUED
1553-140048-0045 NEVER MIND SAID EMMA JANE COMFORTINGLY EVERYBODY SAYS YOU'RE AWFUL BRIGHT AND SMART AND MOTHER THINKS YOU'LL BE BETTER LOOKING ALL THE TIME AS YOU GROW OLDER YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT BUT I WAS A DREADFUL HOMELY BABY
1553-140048-0046 AUNT MIRANDA WOULD SAY THAT WAS JUST LIKE ME AND IT IS BUT I CALLED HIM MISTER ALADDIN BECAUSE HE GAVE US A LAMP YOU KNOW THE STORY OF ALADDIN AND THE WONDERFUL LAMP
1553-140048-0047 OH REBECCA HOW COULD YOU CALL HIM A NICKNAME THE VERY FIRST TIME YOU EVER SAW HIM ALADDIN ISN'T A NICKNAME EXACTLY ANYWAY HE LAUGHED AND SEEMED TO LIKE IT
1553-140048-0048 BY DINT OF SUPERHUMAN EFFORT AND PUTTING SUCH A SEAL UPON THEIR LIPS AS NEVER MORTALS PUT BEFORE THE TWO GIRLS SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING THEIR WONDERFUL NEWS TO THEMSELVES
1553-140048-0049 ON THANKSGIVING THE LAMP ARRIVED IN A LARGE PACKING BOX AND WAS TAKEN OUT AND SET UP BY SEESAW SIMPSON WHO SUDDENLY BEGAN TO ADMIRE AND RESPECT THE BUSINESS ABILITY OF HIS SISTERS
1578-140045-0000 THE STIRRING OF THE POWERS REBECCA'S VISIT TO MILLTOWN WAS ALL THAT HER GLOWING FANCY HAD PAINTED IT EXCEPT THAT RECENT READINGS ABOUT ROME AND VENICE DISPOSED HER TO BELIEVE THAT THOSE CITIES MIGHT HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER MILLTOWN
1578-140045-0001 IN THE MATTER OF MERE PICTORIAL BEAUTY SO SOON DOES THE SOUL OUTGROW ITS MANSIONS THAT AFTER ONCE SEEING MILLTOWN HER FANCY RAN OUT TO THE FUTURE SIGHT OF PORTLAND FOR THAT HAVING ISLANDS AND A HARBOR AND TWO PUBLIC MONUMENTS
1578-140045-0002 MUST BE FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN MILLTOWN WHICH WOULD SHE FELT TAKE ITS PROUD PLACE AMONG THE CITIES OF THE EARTH BY REASON OF ITS TREMENDOUS BUSINESS ACTIVITY RATHER THAN BY ANY IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL TO THE IMAGINATION
1578-140045-0003 I TELL YOU HARRIET BEECHER STOWE HERSELF COULDN'T A DONE IT BETTER JUSTICE I TOOK IT ALL IN RESPONDED MISTER COBB WHO WAS PLEASED THAT MOTHER AGREED WITH HIM ABOUT REBECCA I AIN'T SURE BUT SHE'S GOIN TO TURN OUT SOMETHIN REMARKABLE
1578-140045-0004 LAND NO MOTHER THERE AIN'T NO HOME'PATH BOUT MISS PARKS SHE DRIVES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY I CAN'T SEE REBECCA AS A LADY DOCTOR SOMEHOW MUSED MISSUS COBB HER GIFT O GAB IS WHAT'S GOIN TO BE THE MAKIN OF HER
1578-140045-0005 OR RECITE PIECES LIKE THAT PORTLAND ELOCUTIONIST THAT COME OUT HERE TO THE HARVEST SUPPER I GUESS SHE'LL BE ABLE TO WRITE DOWN HER OWN PIECES SAID MISTER COBB CONFIDENTLY SHE COULD MAKE EM UP FASTER N SHE COULD READ EM OUT OF A BOOK
1578-140045-0006 REBECCA MADE A POOR HAND AT COMPOSITION WRITING AT THIS TIME MISS DEARBORN GAVE HER EVERY SORT OF SUBJECT THAT SHE HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN HERSELF CLOUD PICTURES ABRAHAM LINCOLN NATURE PHILANTHROPY SLAVERY INTEMPERANCE JOY AND DUTY
1578-140045-0007 SOLITUDE BUT WITH NONE OF THEM DID REBECCA SEEM TO GRAPPLE SATISFACTORILY WRITE AS YOU TALK REBECCA INSISTED POOR MISS DEARBORN WHO SECRETLY KNEW THAT SHE COULD NEVER MANAGE A GOOD COMPOSITION HERSELF
1578-140045-0008 NOW IN YOUR LAST ONE ON SOLITUDE YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING VERY INTERESTING AND YOU'VE MADE IT TOO COMMON AND EVERY DAY TO SOUND WELL THERE ARE TOO MANY YOUS AND YOURS IN IT YOU OUGHT TO SAY ONE NOW AND THEN TO MAKE IT SEEM MORE LIKE GOOD WRITING ONE OPENS A FAVORITE BOOK
1578-140045-0009 ONE'S THOUGHTS ARE A GREAT COMFORT IN SOLITUDE AND SO ON I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE ABOUT SOLITUDE THIS WEEK THAN I DID ABOUT JOY AND DUTY LAST WEEK GRUMBLED REBECCA YOU TRIED TO BE FUNNY ABOUT JOY AND DUTY SAID MISS DEARBORN REPROVINGLY SO OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T SUCCEED
1578-140045-0010 OF RECOLLECTION JOY AND DUTY HAD BEEN THE INSPIRING SUBJECT GIVEN TO THE OLDER CHILDREN FOR A THEME TO BE WRITTEN IN FIVE MINUTES REBECCA HAD WRESTLED STRUGGLED PERSPIRED IN VAIN WHEN HER TURN CAME TO READ
1578-140045-0011 SHE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS SHE HAD WRITTEN NOTHING YOU HAVE AT LEAST TWO LINES REBECCA INSISTED THE TEACHER FOR I SEE THEM ON YOUR SLATE
1578-140045-0012 READ WHAT YOU HAVE GOOD OR BAD LITTLE OR MUCH I AM EXCUSING NOBODY REBECCA ROSE OVERCOME WITH SECRET LAUGHTER DREAD AND MORTIFICATION THEN IN A LOW VOICE SHE READ THE COUPLET
1578-140045-0013 AND THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG IDEA SELDOM APPEALED TO THE SENSE OF HUMOR YOU MUST STAY AFTER SCHOOL AND TRY AGAIN REBECCA SHE SAID BUT SHE SAID IT SMILINGLY YOUR POETRY HASN'T A VERY NICE IDEA IN IT FOR A GOOD LITTLE GIRL WHO OUGHT TO LOVE DUTY
1578-140045-0014 IT WASN'T MY IDEA SAID REBECCA APOLOGETICALLY I HAD ONLY MADE THE FIRST LINE WHEN I SAW YOU WERE GOING TO RING THE BELL AND SAY THE TIME WAS UP I HAD CLASH WRITTEN AND I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING THEN BUT HASH OR RASH OR SMASH I'LL CHANGE IT TO THIS
1578-140045-0015 HAVING BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE USE OF THE INDEFINITE PRONOUN ONE AS GIVING A REFINED AND ELEGANT TOUCH TO LITERARY EFFORTS REBECCA PAINSTAKINGLY REWROTE HER COMPOSITION ON SOLITUDE GIVING IT ALL THE BENEFIT OF MISS DEARBORN'S SUGGESTION
1578-140045-0016 IT THEN APPEARED IN THE FOLLOWING FORM WHICH HARDLY SATISFIED EITHER TEACHER OR PUPIL SOLITUDE IT WOULD BE FALSE TO SAY THAT ONE COULD EVER BE ALONE WHEN ONE HAS ONE'S LOVELY THOUGHTS TO COMFORT ONE
1578-140045-0017 ONE SITS BY ONE'S SELF IT IS TRUE BUT ONE THINKS ONE OPENS ONE'S FAVORITE BOOK AND READS ONE'S FAVORITE STORY ONE SPEAKS TO ONE'S AUNT OR ONE'S BROTHER FONDLES ONE'S CAT
1578-140045-0018 DOES ONE EVER FEEL BEREFT WHEN ONE PICKS UP ONE'S CHIPS TO LIGHT ONE'S FIRE FOR ONE'S EVENING MEAL OR WHEN ONE WASHES ONE'S MILK PAIL BEFORE MILKING ONE'S COW ONE WOULD FANCY NOT R R R
1578-140045-0019 DON'T YOU THINK CALLING SUPPER ONE'S EVENING MEAL IS PRETTY AND ISN'T BEREFT A NICE WORD YES THAT PART OF IT DOES VERY WELL IT IS THE CAT THE CHIPS AND THE MILK PAIL THAT I DON'T LIKE
1578-140045-0020 YES I DON'T LIKE A COW IN A COMPOSITION SAID THE DIFFICULT MISS DEARBORN
1578-140045-0021 FOR THE NEXT WEEK MINNIE SMELLIE'S MOTHER TOLD MIRANDA SAWYER THAT SHE'D BETTER LOOK AFTER REBECCA FOR SHE WAS GIVEN TO SWEARING AND PROFANE LANGUAGE THAT SHE HAD BEEN HEARD SAYING SOMETHING DREADFUL THAT VERY AFTERNOON SAYING IT BEFORE EMMA JANE AND LIVING PERKINS WHO ONLY LAUGHED
1578-140045-0022 DON'T BE UGLY AND OBSTINATE BUT THINK REAL HARD WHEN DID THEY CHASE YOU UP THE ROAD AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING A SUDDEN LIGHT BROKE UPON REBECCA'S DARKNESS
1578-140045-0023 EMMA JANE LIVING AND I WERE WALKING ALONG AND I WAS AHEAD I SAW THE WATER STREAMING OVER THE ROAD TOWARDS THE DITCH AND IT REMINDED ME OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN AT MILLTOWN WHEN ELIZA TOOK HER BABY AND RAN ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI ON THE ICE BLOCKS PURSUED BY THE BLOODHOUNDS
1578-140045-0024 WE COULDN'T KEEP FROM LAUGHING AFTER WE CAME OUT OF THE TENT BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTING ON SUCH A SMALL PLATFORM THAT ELIZA HAD TO RUN ROUND AND ROUND
1578-140045-0025 AND PART OF THE TIME SHE HAD TO PURSUE THE DOG I KNEW LIVING WOULD REMEMBER TOO SO I TOOK OFF MY WATERPROOF AND WRAPPED IT ROUND MY BOOKS FOR A BABY
1578-140045-0026 JUST LIKE THAT THE SAME AS ELIZA DID IN THE PLAY THEN I LEAPED FROM PUDDLE TO PUDDLE AND LIVING AND EMMA JANE PURSUED ME LIKE THE BLOODHOUNDS IT'S JUST LIKE THAT STUPID MINNIE SMELLIE WHO DOESN'T KNOW A GAME WHEN SHE SEES ONE AND ELIZA WASN'T SWEARING WHEN SHE SAID MY GOD THE RIVER
1578-140045-0027 IT WAS MORE LIKE PRAYING WELL YOU'VE GOT NO CALL TO BE PRAYIN ANY MORE THAN SWEARIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD SAID MIRANDA BUT I'M THANKFUL IT'S NO WORSE YOU'RE BORN TO TROUBLE AS THE SPARKS FLY UPWARD
1578-140045-0028 AN I'M AFRAID YOU ALLERS WILL BE TILL YOU LEARN TO BRIDLE YOUR UNRULY TONGUE I WISH SOMETIMES THAT I COULD BRIDLE MINNIE'S MURMURED REBECCA AS SHE WENT TO SET THE TABLE FOR SUPPER I DECLARE SHE IS THE BEATIN'EST CHILD SAID MIRANDA
1578-140045-0029 BUT WHETHER IT'S FOR THE BETTER OR THE WORSE I CAN'T HARDLY TELL TILL SHE GROWS UP SHE'S GOT THE MAKING OF MOST ANYTHING IN HER REBECCA HAS BUT I FEEL SOMETIMES AS IF WE WERE NOT FITTED TO COPE WITH HER STUFF AN NONSENSE SAID MIRANDA
1578-140049-0000 THE BANQUET LAMP THERE HAD BEEN COMPANY AT THE BRICK HOUSE TO THE BOUNTIFUL THANKSGIVING DINNER WHICH HAD BEEN PROVIDED AT ONE O'CLOCK THE BURNHAM SISTERS WHO LIVED BETWEEN NORTH RIVERBORO AND SHAKER VILLAGE AND WHO FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
1578-140049-0001 HAD COME TO PASS THE HOLIDAY WITH THE SAWYERS EVERY YEAR REBECCA SAT SILENT WITH A BOOK AFTER THE DINNER DISHES WERE WASHED AND WHEN IT WAS NEARLY FIVE ASKED IF SHE MIGHT GO TO THE SIMPSONS
1578-140049-0002 CAN'T YOU SET STILL FOR ONCE AND LISTEN TO THE IMPROVIN CONVERSATION OF YOUR ELDERS
1578-140049-0003 WHAT UNDER THE CANOPY DID THEY WANT OF A LAMP AND WHERE DID THEY GET THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT IF ABNER WAS AT HOME I SHOULD THINK HE'D BEEN SWAPPIN AGAIN SAID MISS MIRANDA THE CHILDREN GOT IT AS A PRIZE FOR SELLING SOAP REPLIED REBECCA
1578-140049-0004 WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN THE POCKET OF THAT NEW DRESS THAT MAKES IT SAG DOWN SO IT'S MY NUTS AND RAISINS FROM DINNER REPLIED REBECCA WHO NEVER SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING THE MOST INNOCENT ACTION A SECRET FROM HER AUNT MIRANDA THEY'RE JUST WHAT YOU GAVE ME ON MY PLATE WHY DIDN'T YOU EAT THEM
1578-140049-0005 THEY WERE YOUR OWN REBECCA INTERPOSED AUNT JANE AND IF YOU CHOSE TO SAVE THEM TO GIVE AWAY IT IS ALL RIGHT WE OUGHT NEVER TO LET THIS DAY PASS WITHOUT GIVING OUR NEIGHBORS SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR INSTEAD OF TAKING ALL THE TIME TO THINK OF OUR OWN MERCIES
1578-140049-0006 THE BURNHAM SISTERS NODDED APPROVINGLY AS REBECCA WENT OUT AND REMARKED THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A CHILD GROW AND IMPROVE SO FAST IN SO SHORT A TIME THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM LEFT FOR MORE IMPROVEMENT AS YOU'D KNOW IF SHE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH YOU ANSWERED MIRANDA
1578-140049-0007 ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE SAID MISS ELLEN BURNHAM
1578-140049-0008 IT MUST HAVE BEEN CLARA BELLE AND I SHOULD NEVER CALL HER REMARKABLE ANSWERED MISS MIRANDA HAS ADAM BEEN HOME AGAIN YES HE'S BEEN STAYING A FEW DAYS WITH HIS AUNT THERE'S NO LIMIT TO THE MONEY HE'S MAKING THEY SAY AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS PRESENTS FOR ALL THE NEIGHBORS
1578-140049-0009 THIS TIME IT WAS A FULL SET OF FURS FOR MISSUS LADD AND TO THINK WE CAN REMEMBER THE TIME HE WAS A BAREFOOT BOY WITHOUT TWO SHIRTS TO HIS BACK IT IS STRANGE HE HASN'T MARRIED WITH ALL HIS MONEY AND HIM SO FOND OF CHILDREN THAT HE ALWAYS HAS A PACK OF THEM AT HIS HEELS
1578-140049-0010 THERE'S HOPE FOR HIM STILL THOUGH SAID MISS JANE SMILINGLY FOR I DON'T S'POSE HE'S MORE THAN THIRTY HE COULD GET A WIFE IN RIVERBORO IF HE WAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY REMARKED MISS MIRANDA ADAM'S AUNT SAYS HE WAS SO TAKEN WITH THE LITTLE GIRL THAT SOLD THE SOAP CLARA BELLE DID YOU SAY HER NAME WAS

1578-140049-0012 FOR THIS ONE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN CROSS EYED I REMEMBER MISSUS LADD SAYING ADAM REMARKED ABOUT THIS CHILD'S HANDSOME EYES HE SAID IT WAS HER EYES THAT MADE HIM BUY THE THREE HUNDRED CAKES MISSUS LADD HAS IT STACKED UP IN THE SHED CHAMBER
1578-140049-0013 THREE HUNDRED CAKES EJACULATED MIRANDA WELL THERE'S ONE CROP THAT NEVER FAILS IN RIVERBORO WHAT'S THAT ASKED MISS LYDIA POLITELY THE FOOL CROP RESPONDED MIRANDA TERSELY
1578-140049-0014 AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT MUCH TO JANE'S GRATITUDE FOR SHE HAD BEEN NERVOUS AND ILL AT EASE FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES WHAT CHILD IN RIVERBORO COULD BE DESCRIBED AS REMARKABLE AND WINNING SAVE REBECCA WHAT CHILD HAD WONDERFUL EYES EXCEPT THE SAME REBECCA
1578-140049-0015 AND FINALLY WAS THERE EVER A CHILD IN THE WORLD WHO COULD MAKE A MAN BUY SOAP BY THE HUNDRED CAKES SAVE REBECCA MEANTIME THE REMARKABLE CHILD HAD FLOWN UP THE ROAD IN THE DEEPENING DUSK BUT SHE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF HURRYING FOOTSTEPS
1578-140049-0016 AND SAW A WELL KNOWN FIGURE COMING IN HER DIRECTION IN A MOMENT SHE AND EMMA JANE MET AND EXCHANGED A BREATHLESS EMBRACE SOMETHING AWFUL HAS HAPPENED PANTED EMMA JANE DON'T TELL ME IT'S BROKEN EXCLAIMED REBECCA NO OH NO NOT THAT
1578-140049-0017 OUR SELLING THE THREE HUNDRED CAKES CORRECTED REBECCA YOU DID AS MUCH AS I NO I DIDN'T REBECCA RANDALL I JUST SAT AT THE GATE AND HELD THE HORSE YES BUT WHOSE HORSE WAS IT THAT TOOK US TO NORTH RIVERBORO
1578-140049-0018 BUT WHAT'S THE TROUBLE THE SIMPSONS HAVE NO KEROSENE AND NO WICKS I GUESS THEY THOUGHT A BANQUET LAMP WAS SOMETHING THAT LIGHTED ITSELF AND BURNED WITHOUT ANY HELP SEESAW HAS GONE TO THE DOCTOR'S TO TRY IF HE CAN BORROW A WICK AND MOTHER LET ME HAVE A PINT OF OIL BUT SHE SAYS SHE WON'T GIVE ME ANY MORE
1578-140049-0019 WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THE EXPENSE OF KEEPING UP THE LAMP REBECCA NO WE DIDN'T BUT LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT TILL AFTER THE PARTY I HAVE A HANDFUL OF NUTS AND RAISINS AND SOME APPLES I HAVE PEPPERMINTS AND MAPLE SUGAR SAID EMMA JANE THEY HAD A REAL THANKSGIVING DINNER

1578-140049-0021 MISSUS SIMPSON HAD LET THE KITCHEN FIRE DIE OUT AND HAD BROUGHT THE BABY TO GRACE THE FESTAL SCENE
