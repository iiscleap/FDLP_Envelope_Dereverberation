5561-41615-0017 SUCH A DECISION IS WORSE THAN DISOBEDIENCE IT IS LAWLESSNESS
5561-41615-0018 THE STANDARD OF THE SCHOOL WILL BE LOWERED THEREFORE I INTEND TO SIFT THIS MATTER TO THE BOTTOM AND FIND OUT WHAT MISCHIEVOUS INFLUENCE PROMPTED THIS ACT OF INSUBORDINATION REPORT SAYS THAT THIS MOVEMENT ORIGINATED IN THE JUNIOR CLASS
5561-41615-0019 AND THAT A PAPER HAS BEEN CIRCULATED AND SIGNED BY CERTAIN PUPILS WHO PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO PLAY TRUANT AND ATTEND THE MATINEE TO MORROW THE EYES OF GRACE AND HER CHUMS TURNED QUESTIONINGLY TOWARD MABEL ALLISON WHO NODDED SLIGHTLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE SO THAT WAS WHAT ALL THE WHISPERING AND MYSTERY HAD MEANT
5561-41615-0020 GRACE INWARDLY CONGRATULATED HERSELF ON HAVING KEPT CLEAR OF THE WHOLE THING NONE OF HER FRIENDS WERE IMPLICATED EITHER EVEN MABEL HAD REFUSED TO SIGN
5561-41615-0021 WHAT I INSIST UPON KNOWING NOW IS WHO ARE THE REAL CULPRITS BEGINNING WITH THE GIRL WHO ORIGINATED THE PAPER TO THE LAST ONE WHO SIGNED IT
5561-41615-0022 HER EXAMPLE WAS FOLLOWED UNTIL TWO THIRDS OF THE GIRLS PRESENT WERE STANDING THE PRINCIPAL STOOD SILENTLY REGARDING THEM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SEVERITY THAT WAS DECIDEDLY DISCOMFITTING THAT WILL DO SHE SAID CURTLY
5561-41615-0023 AFTER THEY HAD STOOD FOR WHAT SEEMED TO THEM AN AGE BUT WAS REALLY ONLY A COUPLE OF MINUTES YOU MAY BE SEATED THE GIRL WHO COMPOSED AND WROTE THAT AGREEMENT WILL NOW RISE AND EXPLAIN HERSELF WITHOUT HESITATING ELEANOR ROSE AND REGARDED THE PRINCIPAL WITH AN INSOLENT SMILE
5561-41615-0024 I WROTE IT MISS THOMPSON SHE SAID CLEARLY I WROTE IT BECAUSE I WISHED TO
5561-41615-0025 BECAUSE IT HAS SPOILED ALL OUR FUN THERE WAS A GASP OF HORROR AT ELEANOR'S ASSERTION NO ONE HAD EVER BEFORE SPOKEN SO DISRESPECTFULLY TO THEIR REVERED PRINCIPAL MISS SAVELL SAID THE PRINCIPAL QUIETLY ALTHOUGH HER FLASHING EYES AND SET LIPS SHOWED THAT SHE WAS VERY ANGRY
5561-41615-0026 IF YOU HAVE THAT PAPER IN YOUR POSSESSION BRING IT TO ME AT ONCE AND NEVER ANSWER ME AGAIN AS YOU DID JUST NOW YOU ARE BOTH DISRESPECTFUL AND IMPERTINENT BUT MISS THOMPSON'S ANGER TOWARD ELEANOR WAS NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE TEMPEST THAT THE PRINCIPAL HAD AROUSED IN ELEANOR
5561-41615-0027 THE LATTER FLUSHED THEN TURNED PERFECTLY WHITE WITH RAGE STILL STANDING SHE REACHED DOWN
5561-41615-0028 WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS MY CONTEMPT FOR THEM AND RIGHT HERE I ACCUSE GRACE HARLOWE AND HER SORORITY OF GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM MABEL ALLISON YESTERDAY AND CARRYING IT TO YOU THEY ARE ALL TALE BEARERS AND SNEAKS
5561-41615-0029 WITH THESE WORDS ELEANOR ANGRILY FLUNG THE BOOK SHE HELD ON THE DESK AND WALKED DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD THE DOOR BUT MISS THOMPSON BARRED HER WAY STOP MISS SAVELL SHE COMMANDED
5561-41615-0030 I WILL NOT TOLERATE SUCH BEHAVIOR ELEANOR GLARED AT THE PRINCIPAL WHOSE FACE WAS RIGID IN ITS PURPOSE THEN SANK INTO THE NEAREST VACANT SEAT SAYING DEFIANTLY YOU MAY KEEP ME HERE ALL NIGHT IF YOU LIKE
5561-41615-0031 NEVERTHELESS SHE DID NOT AGAIN ATTEMPT TO LEAVE THE ROOM SHE HAD MET WITH A WILL STRONGER THAN HER OWN AND SHE REALIZED IT IGNORING ELEANOR'S FINAL REMARK MISS THOMPSON ONCE MORE TURNED HER ATTENTION TO THE MATTER IN HAND
5561-41615-0032 THOSE GIRLS WHO ARE NOT IN ANY WAY IMPLICATED IN THIS MATTER ARE DISMISSED SHE SAID ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE GIRLS AROSE AND PREPARED TO LEAVE THE STUDY HALL THE PHI SIGMA TAU BEING AMONG THE NUMBER
5561-41615-0033 GRACE MOTIONED THE GIRLS TO HURRY SHE WISHED TO LEAVE THE ROOM WITH HER FRIENDS BEFORE MISS THOMPSON NOTICED THEM SHE KNEW THE PRINCIPAL WOULD INSIST ON AN APOLOGY FROM ELEANOR AND NEITHER SHE NOR HER FRIENDS WISHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE ELEANOR HAD CHOSEN TO CUT THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
5561-41615-0034 GRACE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY WITH HER SHE COULD NOT FORGIVE ELEANOR FOR HAVING ACCUSED HER AND HER FRIENDS OF CARRYING TALES BEFORE ALMOST THE ENTIRE SCHOOL THEREFORE A FORCED APOLOGY WOULD NOT APPEASE HER WOUNDED PRIDE
5561-41615-0035 SHE DREW A BREATH OF RELIEF WHEN THE EIGHT GIRLS WERE SAFELY OUTSIDE THE STUDY HALL DOOR HURRY UP SHE SAID WE'LL TALK WHEN WE GET OUTSIDE SCHOOL DON'T STOP FOR A MINUTE IF MISS THOMPSON NOTICES THAT WE ARE GONE SHE'LL SEND AFTER US
5561-41615-0036 THE GIRLS SILENTLY DONNED THEIR WRAPS AND FLED FROM THE BUILDING LIKE FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE ONCE ON THE STREET A LIVELY CONFAB ENSUED ALL TALKING AT ONCE LET'S TAKE TURNS TALKING CRIED GRACE LAUGHING WE SHALL UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER A LITTLE BETTER
5561-41615-0037 SHE HAS CERTAINLY SHOWN HER TRUE COLORS THIS TIME I NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING MORE UNJUST THAN THE WAY SHE ACCUSED US WHEN WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HER OLD PLAN SAID MARIAN BARBER IT WAS ABOMINABLE SAID EVA ALLEN THE OTHER GIRLS EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL IN EQUALLY FRANK TERMS
5561-41615-0038 I SUPPOSE IT DID LOOK AS THOUGH I TOLD YOU GIRLS SAID MABEL ALLISON WHO HAD JOINED THEM AT THE GATE YOU KNOW I WAS WITH YOU AT RECESS RIGHT AFTER THE PAPER HAD BEEN PASSED TO ME
5561-41615-0039 IT WAS PASSED TO ME BY MISTAKE VERY LIKELY AGREED GRACE I WONDER WHO DID TELL MISS THOMPSON I SAW SEVERAL GIRLS WITH THE PAPER
5561-41615-0040 THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES CROWD EXCLAIMED NORA THEY ARE ALL IN THIS MIX UP AND IF THEY AREN'T SUSPENDED THEY'LL BE LUCKY
5561-41615-0041 NO SAID GRACE SHORTLY SHE DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED THE THINGS SHE SAID TO MISS THOMPSON WERE DISGRACEFUL AND I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE HER FOR THE WAY SHE SPOKE OF US I WOULDN'T SAY THAT GRACE REMARKED ANNE YOU CAN NEVER TELL WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO CHANGE YOUR VIEWS
5561-41615-0042 IT WILL HAVE TO BE SOMETHING REMARKABLE IN THIS INSTANCE REPLIED GRACE GRIMLY AS SHE BADE THE GIRLS GOOD BYE REMEMBER GIRLS BASKETBALL PRACTICE AGAIN TO MORROW AND THE REST OF THE WEEK MISS THOMPSON HAS PROMISED ME THE GYMNASIUM PLEASE MAKE IT A POINT TO BE ON HAND
5561-41615-0043 GOOD BYE GRACE CHORUSED HER FRIENDS AND WENT ON DOWN THE STREET DISCUSSING THE PROBABLE FATE OF THE WOULD BE TRUANTS TO RETURN TO THOSE YOUTHFUL TRANSGRESSORS THEY WERE SPENDING A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE HALF HOUR WITH MISS THOMPSON SHE WAS MERCILESS IN HER DENUNCIATION OF THEIR CONDUCT
5561-41615-0044 AND THE TERROR OF SUSPENSION AROSE IN MORE THAN ONE MIND AS THEY LISTENED TO HER SCATHING REMARKS
5561-41615-0045 BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT IT NOW WHEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ELEANOR THE PRINCIPAL DISMISSED THEM THEY FILED DECOROUSLY OUT VERY UNEASY IN MIND MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN THEIR NAMES BUT HAD NOT STATED THEIR PUNISHMENT AND IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD BE MADE TO FEEL THE FULL WEIGHT OF HER DISPLEASURE
5561-41615-0046 WHEN THE LAST GIRL HAD DISAPPEARED THE PRINCIPAL TURNED TO ELEANOR
5561-41615-0047 DO YOU INTEND TO OBEY ME MISS SAVELL ASKED MISS THOMPSON STILL THERE WAS NO ANSWER VERY WELL CONTINUED MISS THOMPSON YOUR SILENCE INDICATES THAT YOU ARE STILL INSUBORDINATE YOU MAY THEREFORE CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO THINGS
5561-41615-0048 YOU MAY APOLOGIZE TO ME NOW AND TO MORROW TO THE GIRLS YOU HAVE ACCUSED OF TREACHERY
5561-41616-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE JUNIORS FOREVER WHEN THE FOUR CLASSES ASSEMBLED THURSDAY MORNING EVERY GIRL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ELEANOR WAS IN HER SEAT
5561-41616-0001 AFTER CONDUCTING OPENING EXERCISES MISS THOMPSON PRONOUNCED SENTENCE ON THE CULPRITS THEY WERE TO FORFEIT THEIR RECESS LIBRARY AND ALL OTHER PRIVILEGES UNTIL THE END OF THE TERM
5561-41616-0002 THEY MUST TURN IN TWO THEMES EVERY WEEK OF NOT LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED WORDS ON CERTAIN SUBJECTS TO BE ASSIGNED TO THEM IF DURING THIS TIME ANY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE REPORTED FOR A MISDEMEANOR THEY WERE TO BE SUSPENDED WITHOUT DELAY
5561-41616-0003 THEIR PENALTY WAS FAR FROM LIGHT BUT THEY HAD NOT BEEN SUSPENDED AND SO THEY RESOLVED TO ENDURE IT AS BEST THEY MIGHT GRACE HARLOWE FELT A LOAD LIFTED FROM HER MIND WHEN MISS THOMPSON PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THAT SHE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION FROM EITHER MABEL ALLISON OR THE PHI SIGMA TAU
5561-41616-0004 THANK GOODNESS NONE OF US WERE CONCERNED IN THAT AFFAIR SHE TOLD THE MEMBERS OF HER BASKETBALL TEAM AT RECESS THERE ARE TWO GIRLS ON THE SOPHOMORE AND THREE ON THE FRESHMAN TEAM WHOSE BASKETBALL ARDOR WILL HAVE TO COOL UNTIL AFTER THE MID YEAR EXAMS

5652-19215-0005 JEAN VALJEAN DID EVERYTHING SMOOTHED AWAY EVERY DIFFICULTY ARRANGED EVERYTHING MADE EVERYTHING EASY
5652-19215-0006 AND APPARENTLY WITH AS MUCH JOY AS COSETTE HERSELF AS HE HAD BEEN A MAYOR HE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO SOLVE THAT DELICATE PROBLEM
5652-19215-0007 A SURE MEANS OF NOT ENCOUNTERING ANY OBJECTIONS COSETTE WAS THE ONLY SCION OF AN EXTINCT FAMILY COSETTE WAS NOT HIS OWN DAUGHTER BUT THE DAUGHTER OF THE OTHER FAUCHELEVENT TWO BROTHERS FAUCHELEVENT HAD BEEN GARDENERS TO THE CONVENT
5652-19215-0008 PICPUS INQUIRY WAS MADE AT THAT CONVENT THE VERY BEST INFORMATION AND THE MOST RESPECTABLE REFERENCES ABOUNDED THE GOOD NUNS NOT VERY APT AND BUT LITTLE INCLINED TO FATHOM QUESTIONS OF PATERNITY
5652-19215-0009 OF WHICH OF THE TWO FAUCHELEVENTS COSETTE WAS THE DAUGHTER THEY SAID WHAT WAS WANTED AND THEY SAID IT WITH ZEAL AN ACTE DE NOTORIETE WAS DRAWN UP COSETTE BECAME IN THE EYES OF THE LAW MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FAUCHELEVENT

5652-19215-0011 THAT HE WAS APPOINTED UNDER THE NAME OF FAUCHELEVENT AS COSETTE'S GUARDIAN
5652-19215-0012 AS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FRANCS THEY CONSTITUTED A LEGACY BEQUEATHED TO COSETTE BY A DEAD PERSON WHO DESIRED TO REMAIN UNKNOWN THE ORIGINAL LEGACY HAD CONSISTED OF FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS
5652-19215-0013 BUT TEN THOUSAND FRANCS HAD BEEN EXPENDED ON THE EDUCATION OF MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS OF THAT AMOUNT HAVING BEEN PAID TO THE CONVENT THIS LEGACY DEPOSITED IN THE HANDS OF A THIRD PARTY
5652-19215-0014 WAS TO BE TURNED OVER TO COSETTE AT HER MAJORITY OR AT THE DATE OF HER MARRIAGE THIS TAKEN AS A WHOLE WAS VERY ACCEPTABLE AS THE READER WILL PERCEIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SUM DUE WAS HALF A MILLION THERE WERE SOME PECULIARITIES HERE AND THERE IT IS TRUE
5652-19215-0015 THAT THE CLOUD DID NOT LAST LONG SHE HAD MARIUS THE YOUNG MAN ARRIVED THE OLD MAN WAS EFFACED SUCH IS LIFE AND THEN COSETTE HAD FOR LONG YEARS BEEN HABITUATED TO SEEING ENIGMAS AROUND HER
5652-19215-0016 A MYSTERIOUS CHILDHOOD IS ALWAYS PREPARED FOR CERTAIN RENUNCIATIONS
5652-19215-0017 IT IS TRUE THAT HE OVERWHELMED HER WITH GALLANT COMPLIMENTS AND PRESENTS WHILE JEAN VALJEAN WAS BUILDING UP FOR COSETTE A NORMAL SITUATION IN SOCIETY AND AN UNASSAILABLE STATUS
5652-19215-0018 NOTHING SO AMUSED HIM AS BEING MAGNIFICENT HE HAD GIVEN TO COSETTE
