211-122442-0009 HIS HEART SWELLED BY THE INTOXICATION OF JOY FELT READY TO DISSOLVE AWAY AT THE VERY GATE OF THAT TERRESTRIAL PARADISE CALLED LOVE
211-122442-0010 DID I NOT GUESS TRULY IS IT NOT SOME BAD AFFAIR

211-122442-0013 WHICH THE LIBERALITY OF D'ARTAGNAN HAD NOT ENTIRELY EFFACED LEFT ALONE D'ARTAGNAN READ AND REREAD HIS BILLET THEN HE KISSED AND REKISSED TWENTY TIMES THE LINES TRACED BY THE HAND OF HIS BEAUTIFUL MISTRESS

211-122442-0021 D'ARTAGNAN'S INTENTION WAS TO GO OUT WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THE WORTHY MERCER BUT THE LATTER MADE SO POLITE AND FRIENDLY A SALUTATION THAT HIS TENANT FELT OBLIGED NOT ONLY TO STOP BUT TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM
211-122442-0022 BESIDES HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO AVOID A LITTLE CONDESCENSION TOWARD A HUSBAND WHOSE PRETTY WIFE HAS APPOINTED A MEETING WITH YOU THAT SAME EVENING AT SAINT CLOUD
211-122442-0023 THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY FELL UPON THE INCARCERATION OF THE POOR MAN
211-122442-0024 WHOM HE NEVER CEASED TO DESIGNATE DURING HIS ACCOUNT BY THE TITLE OF THE CARDINAL'S EXECUTIONER AND EXPATIATED AT GREAT LENGTH UPON THE BASTILLE THE BOLTS THE WICKETS THE DUNGEONS THE GRATINGS THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE

211-122442-0083 HEAVED A PROFOUND SIGH AND SET TO WORK TO GROOM THE THIRD HORSE
2136-5140-0000 AS ALREADY DETAILED THAT I WAS ONE NIGHT SITTING AT THE GREAT DRAWING ROOM WINDOW LOST IN THE MELANCHOLY REVERIES OF NIGHT AND IN ADMIRATION OF THE MOONLIGHTED SCENE I WAS THE ONLY OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM
2136-5140-0001 HARDLY REACHED TO THE WINDOW AT WHICH I SAT THE SHORN GRASS SLOPED GENTLY DOWNWARD FROM THE WINDOWS TILL IT MET THE BROAD LEVEL ON WHICH STOOD IN CLUMPS OR SOLITARILY SCATTERED SOME OF THE NOBLEST TIMBER IN ENGLAND
2136-5140-0002 HOAR IN THE MOONBEAMS STOOD THOSE GRACEFUL TREES CASTING THEIR MOVELESS SHADOWS UPON THE GRASS AND IN THE BACKGROUND CROWNING THE UNDULATIONS OF THE DISTANCE IN MASSES WERE PILED THOSE WOODS AMONG WHICH LAY THE SOLITARY TOMB
2136-5140-0003 TO ME FUNEREAL BUT GLORIOUS WOODS WHICH FORMED THE BACKGROUND OF THE PICTURE MY THOUGHTS RECURRED TO MY FATHER'S MYSTERIOUS INTIMATIONS AND THE IMAGE OF THE APPROACHING VISITOR AND THE THOUGHT OF THE UNKNOWN JOURNEY SADDENED ME
2136-5140-0004 IN ALL THAT CONCERNED HIS RELIGION FROM VERY EARLY ASSOCIATION THERE WAS TO ME SOMETHING OF THE UNEARTHLY AND SPECTRAL WHEN MY DEAR MAMMA DIED I WAS NOT NINE YEARS OLD AND I REMEMBER TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FUNERAL
2136-5140-0005 THERE CAME TO KNOWL WHERE SHE DIED A THIN LITTLE MAN WITH LARGE BLACK EYES AND A VERY GRAVE DARK FACE HE WAS SHUT UP A GOOD DEAL WITH MY DEAR FATHER WHO WAS IN DEEP AFFLICTION AND MISSUS RUSK USED TO SAY
2136-5140-0006 AND GOOD MISTER CLAY READY AT CALL IN THE VILLAGE MUCH GOOD THAT LITTLE BLACK WHIPPER SNAPPER WILL DO HIM WITH THAT LITTLE BLACK MAN ON THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL I WAS SENT OUT FOR SOME REASON FOR A WALK MY GOVERNESS WAS ILL I KNOW
2136-5140-0007 AND THERE WAS CONFUSION IN THE HOUSE AND I DARE SAY THE MAIDS MADE AS MUCH OF A HOLIDAY AS THEY COULD I REMEMBER FEELING A SORT OF AWE OF THIS LITTLE DARK MAN BUT I WAS NOT AFRAID OF HIM FOR HE WAS GENTLE THOUGH SAD AND SEEMED KIND
2136-5140-0008 HE LED ME INTO THE GARDEN THE DUTCH GARDEN WE USED TO CALL IT WITH A BALUSTRADE AND STATUES AT THE FARTHER FRONT LAID OUT IN A CARPET PATTERN OF BRILLIANTLY COLOURED FLOWERS WE CAME DOWN THE BROAD FLIGHT OF CAEN STONE STEPS INTO THIS
2136-5140-0009 AND WE WALKED IN SILENCE TO THE BALUSTRADE THE BASE WAS TOO HIGH AT THE SPOT WHERE WE REACHED IT FOR ME TO SEE OVER BUT HOLDING MY HAND HE SAID
2136-5140-0010 WELL YOU CAN'T BUT I CAN SEE BEYOND IT SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT I SEE EVER SO MUCH I SEE A COTTAGE WITH A STEEP ROOF THAT LOOKS LIKE GOLD IN THE SUNLIGHT
2136-5140-0011 GROWING BY THE WALLS AND WINDOWS AND TWO LITTLE CHILDREN ARE PLAYING AMONG THE STEMS OF THE TREES AND WE ARE ON OUR WAY THERE AND IN A FEW MINUTES SHALL BE UNDER THOSE TREES OURSELVES AND TALKING TO THOSE LITTLE CHILDREN
2136-5140-0012 YET NOW TO ME IT IS BUT A PICTURE IN MY BRAIN AND TO YOU BUT A STORY TOLD BY ME WHICH YOU BELIEVE COME DEAR LET US BE GOING SO WE DESCENDED THE STEPS AT THE RIGHT
2136-5140-0013 AND THERE WE STOOD IN RICH SUNLIGHT AMONG THE MANY OBJECTS HE HAD DESCRIBED IS THIS YOUR HOUSE MY LITTLE MEN HE ASKED OF THE CHILDREN PRETTY LITTLE ROSY BOYS WHO ASSENTED AND HE LEANED WITH HIS OPEN HAND AGAINST THE STEM OF ONE OF THE TREES
2136-5140-0014 THE SAME ON WHICH I WAS NOW LOOKING IN THE DISTANCE EVERY NOW AND THEN HE MADE ME SIT DOWN TO REST
2136-5140-0015 WOULD RELATE SOME LITTLE STORY REFLECTING EVEN TO MY CHILDISH MIND A STRANGE SUSPICION OF A SPIRITUAL MEANING
2136-5140-0016 AND SOMEHOW STARTLING IN ITS VERY VAGUENESS THUS ENTERTAINED THOUGH A LITTLE AWFULLY I ACCOMPANIED THE DARK MYSTERIOUS LITTLE WHIPPER SNAPPER THROUGH THE WOODLAND GLADES
2136-5140-0017 WE CAME TO ME QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY IN THE DEEP SYLVAN SHADOWS UPON THE GREY PILLARED TEMPLE FOUR FRONTED WITH A SLANTING PEDESTAL OF LICHEN STAINED STEPS
2136-5140-0018 THE LONELY SEPULCHRE IN WHICH I HAD THE MORNING BEFORE SEEN POOR MAMMA LAID AT THE SIGHT THE FOUNTAINS OF MY GRIEF REOPENED AND I CRIED BITTERLY REPEATING OH MAMMA MAMMA LITTLE MAMMA
2136-5140-0019 AND SO WENT ON WEEPING AND CALLING WILDLY ON THE DEAF AND THE SILENT THERE WAS A STONE BENCH SOME TEN STEPS AWAY FROM THE TOMB SIT DOWN BESIDE ME MY CHILD SAID THE GRAVE MAN WITH THE BLACK EYES VERY KINDLY AND GENTLY
2136-5140-0020 NOW WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE HE ASKED POINTING HORIZONTALLY WITH HIS STICK TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE OPPOSITE STRUCTURE OH THAT THAT PLACE WHERE POOR MAMMA IS
2136-5140-0021 YES A STONE WALL WITH PILLARS TOO HIGH FOR EITHER YOU OR ME TO SEE OVER BUT HERE HE MENTIONED A NAME WHICH I THINK MUST HAVE BEEN SWEDENBORG
