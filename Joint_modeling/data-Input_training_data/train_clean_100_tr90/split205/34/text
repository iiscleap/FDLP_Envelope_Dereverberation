201-122255-0032 EACH WATCHING FOR A CHANCE TO TAKE THE OTHER UNAWARE AND SO GET IN THE FIRST BLOW AT LAST LITTLE JOHN STRUCK LIKE A FLASH AND RAP THE TANNER MET THE BLOW AND TURNED IT ASIDE AND THEN SMOTE BACK AT LITTLE JOHN WHO ALSO TURNED THE BLOW AND SO THIS MIGHTY BATTLE BEGAN

201-122255-0043 I WILL FOLLOW THEE TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH GOOD MASTER AND NOT A HERD OF DUN DEER IN ALL THE FOREST BUT SHALL KNOW THE SOUND OF THE TWANG OF MY BOWSTRING AS FOR THEE LITTLE JOHN SAID ROBIN TURNING TO HIM AND LAUGHING
201-122255-0044 THERE ARE OTHER INNS THAT THOU KNOWEST YET HEREABOUTS
201-127786-0000 HAPPY AND FORTUNATE WERE THE TIMES WHEN THAT MOST DARING KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS SENT INTO THE WORLD
201-127786-0001 BUT ALSO OF THE TALES AND EPISODES CONTAINED IN IT WHICH ARE IN A MEASURE NO LESS PLEASING INGENIOUS AND TRUTHFUL THAN THE HISTORY ITSELF WHICH RESUMING ITS THREAD CARDED SPUN AND WOUND RELATES THAT JUST AS THE CURATE WAS GOING TO OFFER CONSOLATION TO CARDENIO
201-127786-0002 ALL THIS WAS HEARD DISTINCTLY BY THE CURATE AND THOSE WITH HIM AND AS IT SEEMED TO THEM TO BE UTTERED CLOSE BY AS INDEED IT WAS THEY GOT UP TO LOOK FOR THE SPEAKER AND BEFORE THEY HAD GONE TWENTY PACES THEY DISCOVERED BEHIND A ROCK SEATED AT THE FOOT OF AN ASH TREE
201-127786-0003 A YOUTH IN THE DRESS OF A PEASANT WHOSE FACE THEY WERE UNABLE AT THE MOMENT TO SEE AS HE WAS LEANING FORWARD BATHING HIS FEET IN THE BROOK THAT FLOWED PAST THEY APPROACHED SO SILENTLY THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THEM BEING FULLY OCCUPIED IN BATHING HIS FEET
201-127786-0004 CRUSH CLODS OR TO FOLLOW THE PLOUGH AND THE OXEN AS THEIR OWNER'S DRESS SUGGESTED AND SO FINDING THEY HAD NOT BEEN NOTICED THE CURATE WHO WAS IN FRONT MADE A SIGN TO THE OTHER TWO TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES BEHIND SOME FRAGMENTS OF ROCK THAT LAY THERE
201-127786-0005 WHICH THEY DID OBSERVING CLOSELY WHAT THE YOUTH WAS ABOUT HE HAD ON A LOOSE DOUBLE SKIRTED DARK BROWN JACKET BOUND TIGHT TO HIS BODY WITH A WHITE CLOTH HE WORE BESIDES BREECHES AND GAITERS OF BROWN CLOTH AND ON HIS HEAD A BROWN MONTERA AND
201-127786-0006 AS THIS IS NOT LUSCINDA IT IS NO HUMAN CREATURE BUT A DIVINE BEING THE YOUTH THEN TOOK OFF THE MONTERA AND SHAKING HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE THERE BROKE LOOSE AND SPREAD OUT A MASS OF HAIR THAT THE BEAMS OF THE SUN MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
201-127786-0007 BY THIS THEY KNEW THAT WHAT HAD SEEMED A PEASANT WAS A LOVELY WOMAN NAY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THE EYES OF TWO OF THEM HAD EVER BEHELD OR EVEN CARDENIO'S IF THEY HAD NOT SEEN AND KNOWN LUSCINDA
201-127786-0008 THE LONG AUBURN TRESSES NOT ONLY COVERED HER SHOULDERS BUT SUCH WAS THEIR LENGTH AND ABUNDANCE CONCEALED HER ALL ROUND BENEATH THEIR MASSES SO THAT EXCEPT THE FEET NOTHING OF HER FORM WAS VISIBLE SHE NOW USED HER HANDS AS A COMB
201-127786-0009 AND IF HER FEET HAD SEEMED LIKE BITS OF CRYSTAL IN THE WATER HER HANDS LOOKED LIKE PIECES OF DRIVEN SNOW AMONG HER LOCKS ALL WHICH INCREASED NOT ONLY THE ADMIRATION OF THE THREE BEHOLDERS BUT THEIR ANXIETY TO LEARN WHO SHE WAS WITH THIS OBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO SHOW THEMSELVES
201-127786-0010 HER DELICATE FEET BEING UNABLE TO BEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF THE STONES SEEING WHICH THE THREE HASTENED TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE ADDRESSING HER FIRST SAID STAY SENORA WHOEVER YOU MAY BE FOR THOSE WHOM YOU SEE HERE ONLY DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
201-127786-0011 YOU HAVE NO NEED TO ATTEMPT A FLIGHT SO HEEDLESS FOR NEITHER CAN YOUR FEET BEAR IT NOR WE ALLOW IT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND BEWILDERED SHE MADE NO REPLY TO THESE WORDS THEY HOWEVER CAME TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE TAKING HER HAND WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0012 WHAT YOUR DRESS WOULD HIDE SENORA IS MADE KNOWN TO US BY YOUR HAIR A CLEAR PROOF THAT IT CAN BE NO TRIFLING CAUSE THAT HAS DISGUISED YOUR BEAUTY IN A GARB SO UNWORTHY OF IT AND SENT IT INTO SOLITUDES LIKE THESE WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND YOU
201-127786-0013 IF NOT TO RELIEVE YOUR DISTRESS AT LEAST TO OFFER YOU COMFORT FOR NO DISTRESS SO LONG AS LIFE LASTS CAN BE SO OPPRESSIVE OR REACH SUCH A HEIGHT AS TO MAKE THE SUFFERER REFUSE TO LISTEN TO COMFORT OFFERED WITH GOOD INTENTION AND SO SENORA
201-127786-0014 BUT ON THE CURATE ADDRESSING SOME FURTHER WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT TO HER SIGHING DEEPLY SHE BROKE SILENCE AND SAID SINCE THE SOLITUDE OF THESE MOUNTAINS HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL ME AND THE ESCAPE OF MY DISHEVELLED TRESSES WILL NOT ALLOW MY TONGUE TO DEAL IN FALSEHOODS
201-127786-0015 IT WOULD BE IDLE FOR ME NOW TO MAKE ANY FURTHER PRETENCE OF WHAT IF YOU WERE TO BELIEVE ME YOU WOULD BELIEVE MORE OUT OF COURTESY THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON
201-127786-0016 THIS BEING SO I SAY I THANK YOU SIRS FOR THE OFFER YOU HAVE MADE ME WHICH PLACES ME UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST YOU HAVE MADE OF ME THOUGH I FEAR THE ACCOUNT I SHALL GIVE YOU OF MY MISFORTUNES WILL EXCITE IN YOU AS MUCH CONCERN AS COMPASSION
201-127786-0017 FOR YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING TO REMEDY THEM OR ANY CONSOLATION TO ALLEVIATE THEM HOWEVER THAT MY HONOUR MAY NOT BE LEFT A MATTER OF DOUBT IN YOUR MINDS NOW THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED ME TO BE A WOMAN
201-127786-0018 I FEEL BOUND TO TELL WHAT I WOULD WILLINGLY KEEP SECRET IF I COULD ALL THIS SHE WHO WAS NOW SEEN TO BE A LOVELY WOMAN DELIVERED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION WITH SO MUCH EASE AND IN SO SWEET A VOICE THAT THEY WERE NOT LESS CHARMED BY HER INTELLIGENCE THAN BY HER BEAUTY
201-127786-0019 AND AS THEY AGAIN REPEATED THEIR OFFERS AND ENTREATIES TO HER TO FULFIL HER PROMISE SHE WITHOUT FURTHER PRESSING FIRST MODESTLY COVERING HER FEET AND GATHERING UP HER HAIR SEATED HERSELF ON A STONE WITH THE THREE PLACED AROUND HER AND
201-127786-0020 AFTER AN EFFORT TO RESTRAIN SOME TEARS THAT CAME TO HER EYES IN A CLEAR AND STEADY VOICE BEGAN HER STORY THUS
201-127786-0021 LOWLY IN ORIGIN BUT SO WEALTHY THAT IF BIRTH HAD CONFERRED AS MUCH ON THEM AS FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING LEFT TO DESIRE NOR SHOULD I HAVE HAD REASON TO FEAR TROUBLE LIKE THAT IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF NOW
201-127786-0022 FOR IT MAY BE THAT MY ILL FORTUNE CAME OF THEIRS IN NOT HAVING BEEN NOBLY BORN IT IS TRUE THEY ARE NOT SO LOW THAT THEY HAVE ANY REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF THEIR CONDITION
201-127786-0023 THEY ARE IN SHORT PEASANTS
201-127786-0024 AND AS THE SAYING IS OLD RUSTY CHRISTIANS BUT SO RICH THAT BY THEIR WEALTH AND FREE HANDED WAY OF LIFE THEY ARE COMING BY DEGREES TO BE CONSIDERED GENTLEFOLK BY BIRTH AND EVEN BY POSITION
201-127786-0025 AND AS THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHILD TO MAKE THEIR HEIR AND ARE AFFECTIONATE PARENTS I WAS ONE OF THE MOST INDULGED DAUGHTERS THAT EVER PARENTS INDULGED
201-127786-0026 ALL THEIR WISHES CENTRED AND MINE WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIRS FOR I KNEW THEIR WORTH AND AS I WAS MISTRESS OF THEIR HEARTS SO WAS I ALSO OF THEIR POSSESSIONS THROUGH ME THEY ENGAGED OR DISMISSED THEIR SERVANTS
201-127786-0027 THROUGH MY HANDS PASSED THE ACCOUNTS AND RETURNS OF WHAT WAS SOWN AND REAPED THE OIL MILLS THE WINE PRESSES THE COUNT OF THE FLOCKS AND HERDS THE BEEHIVES ALL IN SHORT THAT A RICH FARMER LIKE MY FATHER HAS OR CAN HAVE I HAD UNDER MY CARE
201-127786-0028 FOR EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME THAT MUSIC SOOTHES THE TROUBLED MIND AND RELIEVES WEARINESS OF SPIRIT SUCH WAS THE LIFE I LED IN MY PARENTS HOUSE AND IF I HAVE DEPICTED IT THUS MINUTELY IT IS NOT OUT OF OSTENTATION OR TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM RICH BUT
201-127786-0029 AND UNSEEN AS I THOUGHT BY ANY EXCEPT THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE FOR WHEN I WENT TO MASS IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I WAS SO CLOSELY ATTENDED BY MY MOTHER AND THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND
201-127786-0030 FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER SON OF THE DUKE I TOLD OF THE MOMENT THE SPEAKER MENTIONED THE NAME OF DON FERNANDO
201-127786-0031 FOR HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT WHO SHE WAS SHE HOWEVER WITHOUT NOTICING THE EXCITEMENT OF CARDENIO CONTINUING HER STORY WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0032 AND I WAS NOT DISPLEASED AT SEEING MY PRAISES IN HIS LETTERS FOR HOWEVER UGLY WE WOMEN MAY BE IT SEEMS TO ME IT ALWAYS PLEASES US TO HEAR OURSELVES CALLED BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT MY OWN SENSE OF RIGHT WAS OPPOSED TO ALL THIS
201-127786-0033 AS WELL AS THE REPEATED ADVICE OF MY PARENTS WHO NOW VERY PLAINLY PERCEIVED DON FERNANDO'S PURPOSE FOR HE CARED VERY LITTLE IF ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT THEY TOLD ME THEY TRUSTED AND CONFIDED THEIR HONOUR AND GOOD NAME TO MY VIRTUE
201-127786-0034 AND RECTITUDE ALONE AND BADE ME CONSIDER THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DON FERNANDO AND MYSELF FROM WHICH I MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT HIS INTENTIONS WHATEVER HE MIGHT SAY TO THE CONTRARY HAD FOR THEIR AIM HIS OWN PLEASURE RATHER THAN MY ADVANTAGE
201-127786-0035 AND IF I WERE AT ALL DESIROUS OF OPPOSING AN OBSTACLE TO HIS UNREASONABLE SUIT THEY WERE READY THEY SAID TO MARRY ME AT ONCE TO ANYONE I PREFERRED EITHER AMONG THE LEADING PEOPLE OF OUR OWN TOWN OR
201-127786-0036 AND I NEVER GAVE DON FERNANDO A WORD IN REPLY THAT COULD HOLD OUT TO HIM ANY HOPE OF SUCCESS HOWEVER REMOTE ALL THIS CAUTION OF MINE WHICH HE MUST HAVE TAKEN FOR COYNESS HAD APPARENTLY THE EFFECT OF INCREASING HIS WANTON APPETITE FOR
201-127786-0037 OR AT LEAST TO SECURE ADDITIONAL PROTECTORS TO WATCH OVER ME AND THIS INTELLIGENCE OR SUSPICION MADE HIM ACT AS YOU SHALL HEAR ONE NIGHT AS I WAS IN MY CHAMBER WITH NO OTHER COMPANION THAN A DAMSEL WHO WAITED ON ME WITH
201-127786-0038 I HAD NO POWER TO UTTER A CRY NOR I THINK DID HE GIVE ME TIME TO UTTER ONE AS HE IMMEDIATELY APPROACHED ME AND TAKING ME IN HIS ARMS FOR OVERWHELMED AS I WAS I WAS POWERLESS I SAY TO HELP MYSELF HE BEGAN TO MAKE SUCH
201-127786-0039 PROFESSIONS TO ME THAT I KNOW NOT HOW FALSEHOOD COULD HAVE HAD THE POWER OF DRESSING THEM UP TO SEEM SO LIKE TRUTH AND THE TRAITOR CONTRIVED THAT HIS TEARS SHOULD VOUCH FOR HIS WORDS AND HIS SIGHS FOR HIS SINCERITY
201-127786-0040 AND I BEGAN IN SOME DEGREE TO RECOVER MYSELF I SAID TO HIM WITH MORE COURAGE THAN I THOUGHT I COULD HAVE POSSESSED
201-127786-0041 I HAVE MY SELF RESPECT AS MUCH AS YOU A LORD AND GENTLEMAN WITH ME YOUR VIOLENCE WILL BE TO NO PURPOSE YOUR WEALTH WILL HAVE NO WEIGHT YOUR WORDS WILL HAVE NO POWER TO DECEIVE ME NOR YOUR SIGHS OR TEARS TO SOFTEN ME
201-127786-0042 WERE I TO SEE ANY OF THE THINGS I SPEAK OF IN HIM WHOM MY PARENTS GAVE ME AS A HUSBAND HIS WILL SHOULD BE MINE AND MINE SHOULD BE BOUNDED BY HIS AND MY HONOUR BEING PRESERVED EVEN THOUGH MY INCLINATIONS WERE NOT
201-127786-0043 AND THIS I SAY LEST YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE THAT ANY BUT MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SHALL EVER WIN ANYTHING OF ME IF THAT
201-127786-0044 BE THE ONLY SCRUPLE YOU FEEL FAIREST DOROTHEA FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS UNHAPPY BEING SEE HERE I GIVE YOU MY HAND TO BE YOURS AND LET HEAVEN
201-127786-0045 BUT HE WAS UNWILLING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY AND WISHED TO HEAR THE END OF WHAT HE ALREADY ALL BUT KNEW SO HE MERELY SAID WHAT
201-127786-0046 I HAVE HEARD OF ANOTHER OF THE SAME NAME WHO CAN PERHAPS MATCH YOUR MISFORTUNES BUT PROCEED BY AND BY I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU AS MUCH AS IT WILL EXCITE YOUR COMPASSION DOROTHEA WAS STRUCK BY CARDENIO'S WORDS AS WELL AS BY HIS STRANGE AND MISERABLE ATTIRE
201-127786-0047 AND BEGGED HIM IF HE KNEW ANYTHING CONCERNING HER TO TELL IT TO HER AT ONCE FOR IF FORTUNE HAD LEFT HER ANY BLESSING IT WAS COURAGE TO BEAR WHATEVER CALAMITY MIGHT FALL UPON HER AS SHE FELT SURE THAT NONE COULD REACH HER CAPABLE OF INCREASING IN ANY DEGREE WHAT SHE ENDURED ALREADY
201-127786-0048 I WOULD NOT LET THE OCCASION PASS SENORA REPLIED CARDENIO OF TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK
201-127786-0049 AND ONE OF HIS VASSALS I TOLD HIM NOT TO LET MY BEAUTY SUCH AS IT WAS BLIND HIM
201-127786-0050 FOR MARRIAGES SO UNEQUAL NEVER BROUGHT HAPPINESS NOR DID THEY CONTINUE LONG TO AFFORD THE ENJOYMENT THEY BEGAN WITH ALL THIS THAT I HAVE NOW REPEATED I SAID TO HIM AND MUCH MORE WHICH I CANNOT RECOLLECT BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT IN INDUCING HIM TO FOREGO HIS PURPOSE
201-127786-0051 AT THE SAME TIME I ARGUED THE MATTER BRIEFLY IN MY OWN MIND SAYING TO MYSELF I SHALL NOT BE THE FIRST WHO HAS RISEN THROUGH MARRIAGE FROM A LOWLY TO A LOFTY STATION NOR WILL DON FERNANDO BE THE FIRST WHOM BEAUTY OR AS IS MORE LIKELY A BLIND ATTACHMENT
201-127786-0052 HAS LED TO MATE HIMSELF BELOW HIS RANK THEN SINCE I AM INTRODUCING NO NEW USAGE OR PRACTICE
201-127786-0053 PASSED THROUGH MY MIND IN A MOMENT BUT THE OATHS OF DON FERNANDO THE WITNESSES HE APPEALED TO THE TEARS HE SHED AND LASTLY THE CHARMS OF HIS PERSON AND HIS HIGH BRED GRACE WHICH ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH SIGNS OF GENUINE LOVE
201-127786-0054 THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
201-127786-0055 CALLED DOWN UPON HIMSELF A THOUSAND CURSES HEREAFTER SHOULD HE FAIL TO KEEP HIS PROMISE SHED MORE TEARS REDOUBLED HIS SIGHS
201-127786-0056 AND SO I WAS LEFT BY MY MAID AND CEASED TO BE ONE AND HE BECAME A TRAITOR AND A PERJURED MAN THE DAY WHICH FOLLOWED THE NIGHT OF MY MISFORTUNE DID NOT COME SO QUICKLY I IMAGINE AS DON FERNANDO WISHED
201-127786-0057 WHO WAS INDEED THE ONE WHO HAD ADMITTED HIM GAINED THE STREET BEFORE DAYBREAK BUT ON TAKING LEAVE OF ME HE TOLD ME THOUGH NOT WITH AS MUCH EARNESTNESS AND FERVOUR AS WHEN HE CAME THAT I MIGHT REST ASSURED OF HIS FAITH AND OF THE SANCTITY AND SINCERITY OF HIS OATHS
201-127786-0058 AND TO CONFIRM HIS WORDS HE DREW A RICH RING OFF HIS FINGER AND PLACED IT UPON MINE HE THEN TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND I WAS LEFT I KNOW NOT WHETHER SORROWFUL OR HAPPY ALL I CAN SAY IS I WAS LEFT AGITATED AND TROUBLED IN MIND AND ALMOST BEWILDERED BY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
201-127786-0059 AND I HAD NOT THE SPIRIT OR ELSE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO CHIDE MY MAID FOR THE TREACHERY SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF IN CONCEALING DON FERNANDO IN MY CHAMBER FOR AS YET I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHETHER WHAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WAS FOR GOOD OR EVIL
201-127786-0060 I TOLD DON FERNANDO AT PARTING THAT AS I WAS NOW HIS HE MIGHT SEE ME ON OTHER NIGHTS IN THE SAME WAY UNTIL IT SHOULD BE HIS PLEASURE TO LET THE MATTER BECOME KNOWN BUT EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE CAME NO MORE NOR FOR MORE THAN A MONTH COULD I CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM IN THE STREET OR IN CHURCH
201-127786-0061 WHILE I WEARIED MYSELF WITH WATCHING FOR ONE
201-127786-0062 I REMEMBER TOO HOW MY MAID HEARD THOSE WORDS IN REPROOF OF HER AUDACITY THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE AND HOW I WAS FORCED TO PUT A CONSTRAINT ON MY TEARS AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF MY COUNTENANCE NOT TO GIVE MY PARENTS CAUSE TO ASK ME WHY I WAS SO MELANCHOLY
201-127786-0063 AND DRIVE ME TO INVENT FALSEHOODS IN REPLY BUT ALL THIS WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO AN END FOR THE TIME CAME WHEN ALL SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE DISREGARDED AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER QUESTION OF HONOUR WHEN MY PATIENCE GAVE WAY AND THE SECRET OF MY HEART BECAME KNOWN ABROAD
201-127786-0064 IT WAS SAID TOO THAT HER NAME WAS LUSCINDA AND THAT AT THE BETROTHAL SOME STRANGE THINGS HAD HAPPENED
201-127786-0065 DOROTHEA HOWEVER DID NOT INTERRUPT HER STORY BUT WENT ON IN THESE WORDS THIS SAD INTELLIGENCE REACHED MY EARS
201-127786-0066 AND WHOM I ENTREATED TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE CITY WHERE I HEARD MY ENEMY WAS
201-127786-0067 AN AFFAIR OF SUCH NOTORIETY IN THE CITY THAT IT WAS THE TALK OF EVERY KNOT OF IDLERS IN THE STREET HE SAID THAT ON THE NIGHT OF DON FERNANDO'S BETROTHAL WITH LUSCINDA AS SOON AS SHE HAD CONSENTED TO BE HIS BRIDE BY SAYING YES SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN FAINTING FIT
201-127786-0068 AND THAT ON THE BRIDEGROOM APPROACHING TO UNLACE THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS TO GIVE HER AIR
201-127786-0069 ON SEEING THIS DON FERNANDO PERSUADED THAT LUSCINDA HAD BEFOOLED SLIGHTED AND TRIFLED WITH HIM ASSAILED HER BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON AND TRIED TO STAB HER WITH THE DAGGER THAT HAD BEEN FOUND AND WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD NOT HER PARENTS AND THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT PREVENTED HIM
201-127786-0070 IT WAS SAID MOREOVER THAT DON FERNANDO WENT AWAY AT ONCE AND THAT LUSCINDA DID NOT RECOVER FROM HER PROSTRATION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE TOLD HER PARENTS HOW SHE WAS REALLY THE BRIDE OF THAT CARDENIO I HAVE MENTIONED I LEARNED BESIDES THAT CARDENIO
201-127786-0071 ACCORDING TO REPORT HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BETROTHAL AND THAT UPON SEEING HER BETROTHED CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATION HE HAD QUITTED THE CITY IN DESPAIR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LETTER DECLARING THE WRONG LUSCINDA HAD DONE HIM AND HIS INTENTION OF GOING WHERE NO ONE SHOULD EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
201-127786-0072 ALL THIS WAS A MATTER OF NOTORIETY IN THE CITY AND EVERYONE SPOKE OF IT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT LUSCINDA WAS MISSING FROM HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND FROM THE CITY FOR SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE TO THE DISTRACTION OF HER PARENTS WHO KNEW NOT WHAT STEPS TO TAKE TO RECOVER HER WHAT I LEARNED
201-127786-0073 REVIVED MY HOPES AND I WAS BETTER PLEASED NOT TO HAVE FOUND DON FERNANDO THAN TO FIND HIM MARRIED FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT YET ENTIRELY SHUT UPON RELIEF IN MY CASE AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HEAVEN HAD PUT THIS IMPEDIMENT IN THE WAY OF THE SECOND MARRIAGE
201-127786-0074 TO LEAD HIM TO RECOGNISE HIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORMER ONE AND REFLECT THAT AS A CHRISTIAN HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER HIS SOUL ABOVE ALL HUMAN OBJECTS ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND AND I STROVE TO COMFORT MYSELF WITHOUT COMFORT
201-127786-0075 INDULGING IN FAINT AND DISTANT HOPES OF CHERISHING THAT LIFE THAT I NOW ABHOR BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE CITY UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO AS I COULD NOT FIND DON FERNANDO I HEARD NOTICE GIVEN BY THE PUBLIC CRIER OFFERING A GREAT REWARD TO ANYONE WHO SHOULD FIND ME
