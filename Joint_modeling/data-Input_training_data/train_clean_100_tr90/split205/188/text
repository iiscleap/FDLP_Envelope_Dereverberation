7402-90848-0062 WHEN THE REJOICINGS WERE OVER
7447-91186-0000 HOW SOON KEYS WERE ADDED TO THE MONOCHORD AS THIS MEASURING INSTRUMENT WAS NAMED CANNOT POSITIVELY BE ASCERTAINED WE MAY SAFELY ASSUME IT WAS NOT SLOW IN ADOPTING THE RUDE KEYBOARD ASCRIBED BY TRADITION TO PAN PIPES
7447-91186-0001 AND APPLIED TO THE PORTABLE ORGAN OF EARLY CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES AFTER THE TENTH CENTURY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MONOCHORD SEEMS TO HAVE BEGUN IN EARNEST TWO OR MORE STRINGS OF EQUAL LENGTH ARE NOW DIVIDED
7447-91186-0002 AND SET IN MOTION BY FLAT METAL WEDGES ATTACHED TO THE KEY LEVERS AND CALLED TANGENTS BECAUSE THEY TOUCHED THE STRINGS IN RESPONSE TO THE DEMAND FOR INCREASED RANGE AS MANY AS TWENTY KEYS
7447-91186-0003 WERE BROUGHT TO ACT ON A FEW STRINGS COMMANDING OFTEN THREE OCTAVES
7447-91186-0004 THE FAMOUS SIGHT READING MUSIC TEACHER OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY ADVISED HIS PUPILS TO EXERCISE THE HAND IN THE USE OF THE MONOCHORD SHOWING HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE KEYBOARD THE KEYED MONOCHORD GAINED THE NAME
7447-91186-0005 CLAVICHORD ITS BOX LIKE CASE WAS FIRST PLACED ON A TABLE LATER ON ITS OWN STAND AND INCREASED IN ELEGANCE NOT UNTIL THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WAS EACH KEY PROVIDED WITH A SEPARATE STRING
7447-91186-0006 OR KEYBOARD INSTRUMENTS THAT CAME INTO USE DANCE MUSIC FOUND IN THEM A CONGENIAL FIELD
7447-91186-0007 I ANSWER THAT YOU CANNOT YET OWING TO YOUR YOUTH UNDERSTAND THAT PLAYING IS ONLY SUITED FOR VOLATILE FRIVOLOUS WOMEN WHEREAS I DESIRE YOU TO BE THE MOST LOVABLE MAIDEN IN THE WORLD
7447-91186-0008 ALSO IT WOULD BRING YOU BUT LITTLE PLEASURE OR RENOWN IF YOU SHOULD PLAY BADLY
7447-91186-0009 CONSIDER A MOMENT WHETHER THIS WOULD BECOME YOU IF YOUR FRIENDS WISH YOU TO PLAY IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM PLEASURE TELL THEM YOU DO NOT DESIRE TO MAKE YOURSELF RIDICULOUS IN THEIR EYES AND BE CONTENT WITH YOUR BOOKS AND YOUR DOMESTIC OCCUPATIONS
7447-91186-0010 A DIFFERENT VIEW WAS ENTERTAINED IN ENGLAND DURING QUEEN ELIZABETH'S REIGN WHERE CLAVIERS WERE IN VOGUE STYLED VIRGINALS BECAUSE AS AN ANCIENT CHRONICLE EXPLAINED VIRGINS DO MOST COMMONLY PLAY ON THEM
7447-91186-0011 THE VIRGINAL WAS USUALLY OF OBLONG SHAPE OFTEN RESEMBLING A LADY'S WORKBOX WITH THE VIRGIN QUEEN IT WAS A PRIME FAVORITE ALTHOUGH NOT NAMED EXPRESSLY FOR HER AS THE FLATTERING FASHION OF THE TIME LED MANY TO ASSUME
7447-91186-0012 IF SHE ACTUALLY DID JUSTICE TO SOME OF THE AIRS WITH VARIATIONS IN THE QUEEN ELIZABETH VIRGINAL BOOK SHE MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN PROFICIENT ON THE INSTRUMENT QUAINT DOCTOR CHARLES BURNEY
7447-91186-0013 SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN DECLARES IN HIS HISTORY OF MUSIC THAT NO PERFORMER OF HIS DAY COULD PLAY THEM WITHOUT AT LEAST A MONTH'S PRACTICE
7447-91186-0014 THE CLAVIER GAVE PROMISE OF ITS DESTINED CAREER IN THE ELIZABETHAN AGE SHAKESPEARE IMMORTALIZED IT AND WILLIAM BYRD
7447-91186-0015 BECAME THE FIRST CLAVIER MASTER HE AND DOCTOR JOHN BULL
7447-91186-0016 REPRESENT THE TWO TYPES WHICH RUN THROUGH THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE CLAVIER BYRD WAS THE MORE INTIMATE DELICATE SPIRITUAL INTELLECT BULL THE UNTAMED GENIUS THE BRILLIANT
7447-91186-0017 EXECUTANT THE LESS EXQUISITELY REFINED ARTIST IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THESE TWO TYPES STAND TOGETHER ON THE THRESHOLD OF CLAVIER ART
7447-91186-0018 THE FOUNDING OF WHOSE CHAIR OF MUSIC IS POPULARLY ATTRIBUTED TO ALFRED THE GREAT AS EARLY AS THE YEAR FOURTEEN HUNDRED CLAVIERS HAD APPEARED WHOSE STRINGS WERE PLUCKED BY QUILLS
7447-91186-0019 ATTACHED TO JACKS AT THE END OF THE KEY LEVERS TO THIS GROUP BELONGED THE VIRGINAL OR VIRGINALS THE CLAVICEMBALO THE HARPSICHORD OR CLAVECIN AND THE SPINET STOPS WERE ADDED AS IN THE ORGAN
7447-91186-0020 THAT VARIED EFFECTS MIGHT BE PRODUCED AND A SECOND KEYBOARD WAS OFTEN PLACED ABOVE THE FIRST THE CASE WAS EITHER RECTANGULAR OR FOLLOWED THE OUTLINES OF THE HARP A PROGENITOR OF THIS CLAVIER TYPE
7447-91186-0021 THE SECULAR MUSIC PRINCIPLE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THAT CALLED INTO ACTIVE BEING THE ORCHESTRA LED ALSO TO A DESIRE FOR RICHER MUSICAL EXPRESSION IN HOME AND SOCIAL LIFE THAN THE FASHIONABLE LUTE AFFORDED
7447-91186-0022 AND THE CLAVIER ADVANCED IN FAVOR IN FRANCE BY FIFTEEN THIRTY THE DANCE THAT PROMOTER OF PURE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC WAS FREELY TRANSCRIBED FOR THE CLAVIER LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY LATER JEAN BAPTISTE LULLY
7447-91186-0023 EXTENSIVELY EMPLOYED THE INSTRUMENT IN THE ORCHESTRATION OF HIS OPERAS AND WROTE SOLO DANCES FOR IT
7447-91186-0024 NOW WELL NIGH FORGOTTEN ALTHOUGH ONCE MENTIONED IN THE SAME BREATH WITH MOLIERE WROTE THE PIONEER CLAVIER INSTRUCTION BOOK IN IT HE DIRECTS SCHOLARS HOW TO AVOID A HARSH TONE AND HOW TO FORM A LEGATO STYLE
7447-91186-0025 HE ADVISES PARENTS TO SELECT TEACHERS ON WHOM IMPLICIT RELIANCE MAY BE PLACED AND TEACHERS TO KEEP THE CLAVIERS OF BEGINNERS UNDER LOCK AND KEY THAT THERE MAY BE NO PRACTICING WITHOUT SUPERVISION HIS SUGGESTIONS DESERVE CONSIDERATION TO DAY
7447-91186-0026 HE WAS THE FIRST TO ENCOURAGE PROFESSIONAL CLAVIER PLAYING AMONG WOMEN HIS DAUGHTER MARGUERITE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN APPOINTED OFFICIAL COURT CLAVIER PLAYER HE COMPOSED FOR THE CLAVIER LITTLE PICTURE TUNES
7447-91186-0027 DESIGNED TO DEPICT SENTIMENTS MOODS PHASES OF CHARACTER AND SCENES FROM LIFE HE FASHIONED MANY CHARMING TURNS OF EXPRESSION INTRODUCED AN OCCASIONAL TEMPO RUBATO FORESHADOWED THE INTELLECTUAL
7447-91186-0028 ELEMENT IN MUSIC AND LAID THE CORNER STONE OF MODERN PIANO PLAYING JEAN PHILIPPE RAMEAU
7447-91186-0029 CONTINUED COUPERIN'S WORK WHAT IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE FIRST PERIOD OF CLAVIER VIRTUOSITY BEGINS WITH THE NEAPOLITAN DOMENICO SCARLATTI
7447-91186-0030 AND JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH
7447-91186-0031 THE GERMAN OF GERMANS THE STYLE OF SCARLATTI IS PECULIARLY THE PRODUCT OF ITALIAN LOVE OF BEAUTIFUL TONE
7447-91186-0032 KEPT WELL IN VIEW THE TECHNICAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE HARPSICHORD HIS CAT'S FUGUE AND HIS ONE MOVEMENT SONATAS STILL APPEAR ON CONCERT PROGRAMMES IN A COLLECTION OF THIRTY SONATAS HE EXPLAINED HIS PURPOSE IN THESE WORDS
7447-91186-0033 AMATEUR OR PROFESSOR WHOEVER THOU ART SEEK NOT IN THESE COMPOSITIONS FOR ANY PROFOUND FEELING THEY ARE ONLY A FROLIC OF ART MEANT TO INCREASE THY CONFIDENCE IN THE CLAVIER
7447-91186-0034 IN GERMANY WITH GRAND OLD FATHER BACH THE KEYBOARD INSTRUMENT WAS FOUND CAPABLE OF MIRRORING A MIGHTY SOUL THE GERM OF ALL MODERN MUSICAL DESIGN LIES IN HIS CLAVIER WRITINGS
7447-91186-0035 IT HAS BEEN APTLY SAID OF THIS MASTER OF MASTERS THAT HE CONSTRUCTED A GREAT UNIVERSITY OF MUSIC FROM WHICH ALL MUST GRADUATE WHO WOULD ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING OF VALUE IN MUSIC MEN OF GENIUS FROM MOZART TO THE PRESENT TIME
7447-91186-0036 HAVE EXTOLLED HIM FOR THE BEAUTY OF HIS MELODIES AND HARMONIES THE EXPRESSIVENESS OF HIS MODULATIONS THE WEALTH SPONTANEITY AND LOGICAL CLEARNESS OF HIS IDEAS AND THE SUPERB ARCHITECTURE OF HIS PRODUCTIONS
7447-91186-0037 STUDENTS MISS THE SOUL OF BACH BECAUSE OF THE SOULLESS MECHANICAL WAY IN WHICH THEY DEFACE HIS LEGACY TO THEM HIS TWELVE LITTLE PRELUDES ALONE CONTAIN THE MATERIALS FOR AN ENTIRE SYSTEM OF MUSIC THE INVENTIONS
7447-91186-0038 TOO OFTEN TREATED AS DRY AS DUST STUDIES ARE LADEN WITH BEAUTIFUL FIGURES AND DEVICES THAT FURNISH INSPIRATION FOR ALL TIME AS INDICATED BY THEIR TITLE WHICH SIGNIFIES A COMPOUND OF APPROPRIATE EXPRESSION
7447-91186-0039 AND JUST DISPOSITION OF THE MEMBERS THEY WERE DESIGNED TO CULTIVATE THE ELEMENTS OF MUSICAL TASTE AS WELL AS FREEDOM AND EQUALITY OF THE FINGERS HIS WELL TEMPERED CLAVICHORD HAS BEEN CALLED THE PIANIST'S SACRED BOOK
7447-91186-0040 ITS PRELUDES AND FUGUES ILLUSTRATE EVERY SHADE OF HUMAN FEELING AND WERE ESPECIALLY DESIGNED TO EXEMPLIFY THE MODE OF TUNING KNOWN AS EQUAL TEMPERAMENT INTRODUCED INTO GENERAL USE BY BACH
7447-91186-0041 AND STILL EMPLOYED BY YOUR PIANO TUNER AND MINE FORKEL HIS BIOGRAPHER HAS FINELY SAID THAT BACH CONSIDERED THE VOICES OF HIS FUGUES A SELECT COMPANY OF PERSONS CONVERSING TOGETHER
7447-91186-0042 EACH WAS ALLOWED TO SPEAK ONLY WHEN THERE WAS SOMETHING TO SAY BEARING ON THE SUBJECT IN HAND A HIGHLY CHARACTERISTIC MOTIVE OR THEME AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE NOBLEST TYPICAL PHRASE
7447-91186-0043 DEVELOPING INTO EQUALLY CHARACTERISTIC PROGRESSIONS AND CADENCES IS A STRIKING FEATURE OF THE BACH FUGUE HIS SUITES EXALTED FOREVER THE FAMILIAR DANCE TUNES OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE HIS WONDERFUL CHROMATIC FANTASIA AND FUGUE
7447-91187-0000 THE PIANO BARD THE PIANO RHAPSODIST THE PIANO MIND THE PIANO SOUL IS CHOPIN SAID RUBINSTEIN TRAGIC ROMANTIC LYRIC HEROIC DRAMATIC FANTASTIC SOULFUL
7447-91187-0001 SWEET DREAMY BRILLIANT GRAND SIMPLE ALL POSSIBLE EXPRESSIONS ARE FOUND IN HIS COMPOSITIONS AND ALL ARE SUNG BY HIM ON HIS INSTRUMENT
7447-91187-0002 IN THESE FEW BOLD STROKES ONE WHO KNEW HIM BY VIRTUE OF CLOSE ART AND RACE KINSHIP PRESENTS AN INCOMPARABLE OUTLINE SKETCH OF THE POLISH TONE POET
7447-91187-0003 WHO EXPLORED THE HARMONIC VASTNESS OF THE PIANOFORTE AND MADE HIS OWN ALL ITS MYSTIC SECRETS BORN AND BRED ON POLAND'S SOIL SON OF A FRENCH FATHER AND A POLISH MOTHER FREDERIC CHOPIN
7447-91187-0004 COMBINED WITHIN HIMSELF TWO NATURES EACH COMPLEMENTING THE OTHER BOTH UNITING TO FORM A PERSONALITY NOT UNDERSTOOD BY EVERY CASUAL OBSERVER HE IS DESCRIBED AS KIND COURTEOUS
7447-91187-0005 POSSESSED OF THE MOST CAPTIVATING GRACE AND EASE OF MANNER NOW INCLINED TO LANGUOROUS MELANCHOLY NOW SCINTILLATING WITH A JOYOUS VIVACITY THAT WAS CONTAGIOUS
7447-91187-0006 HIS SENSITIVE NATURE LIKE THE MOST EXQUISITELY CONSTRUCTED SOUNDING BOARD VIBRATED WITH THE DESPAIRING SADNESS THE SUPPRESSED WRATH AND THE SUBLIME FORTITUDE OF THE BRAVE HAUGHTY
7447-91187-0007 UNHAPPY PEOPLE HE LOVED AND WITH HIS OWN HOMESICKNESS WHEN AFAR FROM HIS CHERISHED NATIVE LAND PATRIOT AND TONE POET IN EVERY FIBRE OF HIS BEING
7447-91187-0008 HIS GENIUS INEVITABLY CLAIMED AS ITS OWN THE SOUL'S DIVINEST LANGUAGE PURE MUSIC UNFETTERED BY WORDS THE PROFOUND RESERVE OF HIS NATURE MADE IT PECULIARLY
7447-91187-0009 AGREEABLE TO HIM TO GRATIFY THE HAUNTING DEMANDS OF HIS LYRIC MUSE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE ONE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT THAT LENDS ITSELF IN PRIVACY TO THE EXPLOITATION OF ALL THE MYSTERIES OF HARMONY
7447-91187-0010 STRONG CONVICTION IN REGARD TO HIS OWN CALLING AND CLEAR PERCEPTION OF THE HIDDEN POWERS AND FUTURE MISSION OF THE PIANO EARLY COMPELLED HIM TO CONSECRATE TO IT HIS UNFALTERING DEVOTION
7447-91187-0011 HE EVOLVED FROM ITS MORE INTIMATE DOMAIN EFFECTS IN SYMPATHY WITH THOSE OF THE ORCHESTRA YET PURELY INDIVIDUAL HE ENRICHED IT WITH NEW MELODIC HARMONIC AND RHYTHMIC DEVICES ADAPTED TO ITSELF ALONE
7447-91187-0012 AND ENDOWED IT WITH A WARMTH OF TONE COLORING THAT SPIRITUALIZED IT FOR ALL TIME TO THE PIANO HE CONFIDED ALL THE CONFLICTS THAT RAGED WITHIN HIM ALL THE COURAGE AND LIVING HOPE THAT SUSTAINED HIM
7447-91187-0013 IN GIVING TONAL FORM TO THE DEEP THINGS OF THE SOUL WHICH ARE UNIVERSAL IN THEIR ESSENCE AND APPLICATION HE EMBODIED UNIVERSAL RATHER THAN MERELY INDIVIDUAL EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES
7447-91187-0014 AND THUS UNBARED WHAT WAS MOST SACRED TO HIMSELF WITHOUT JARRING ON THE INNATE RETICENCE WHICH MADE PURELY PERSONAL CONFIDENCES IMPOSSIBLE
7447-91187-0015 ALTHOUGH HIS MODE OF EXPRESSION WAS PECULIARLY HIS OWN HE HAD RECEIVED A STRONG IMPULSE FROM THE POPULAR MUSIC OF POLAND
7447-91187-0016 THEY WERE HIS EARLIEST MODELS ON THEM WERE BUILDED HIS FIRST THEMES
7447-91187-0017 SO CHOPIN GLORIFIED THOSE OF THE POLES THE NATIONAL TONALITY BECAME TO HIM A VEHICLE TO BE FREIGHTED WITH HIS OWN INDIVIDUAL CONCEPTIONS I SHOULD LIKE TO BE TO MY PEOPLE
7447-91187-0018 WHAT UHLAND WAS TO THE GERMANS HE ONCE SAID TO A FRIEND HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE AND IMMORTALIZED ITS JOYS SORROWS AND CAPRICES BY THE FORCE OF HIS SPLENDID ART
7447-91187-0019 THOSE WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO INTERPRET HIM AS THE SENTIMENTAL HERO OF MINOR MOODS THE TONE POET IN WHOM THE WEAKNESS OF DESPAIR PREDOMINATES HAVE MISSED THE LEAPING FLAMES THE VIVID INTENSITY
7447-91187-0020 TRUE ART SOFTENS THE HARSHEST ACCENTS OF SUFFERING BY PLACING SUPERIOR TO IT SOME ELEVATING IDEA SO IN THE MOST MELANCHOLY STRAINS OF HIS MUSIC ONE WHO HEEDS WELL MAY DETECT THE PRESENCE OF A LOFTY IDEAL
7447-91187-0021 THAT UPLIFTS AND STRENGTHENS THE TRAVAILING SOUL IT HAS BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT HE HAD A SAD HEART BUT A JOYFUL MIND THE TWO TEACHERS OF CHOPIN WERE
7447-91187-0022 ZWYNY A BOHEMIAN VIOLINIST WHO TAUGHT THE PIANO AND JOSEPH ELSNER A VIOLINIST ORGANIST AND THEORIST FROM ZWYNY AND ELSNER EVEN THE GREATEST DUNCE MUST LEARN SOMETHING HE IS QUOTED AS SAYING
7447-91187-0023 NEITHER OF THESE MEN ATTEMPTED TO HAMPER HIS FREE GROWTH BY RIGID TECHNICAL RESTRAINTS THEIR GUIDANCE LEFT HIM MASTER OF HIS OWN GENIUS AT LIBERTY TO SOAR LIKE THE LARK INTO THE ETHEREAL BLUE OF THE SKIES
7447-91187-0024 HE RESPECTED THEM BOTH A REVERING AFFECTION WAS CHERISHED BY HIM FOR ELSNER TO WHOM HE OWED HIS SENSE OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO HIS ART HIS HABITS OF SERIOUS STUDY
7447-91187-0025 AND HIS INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH BACH THERE IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN THE FACT THAT THIS PRINCE CHARMING OF THE PIANO WHOSE MAGIC TOUCH AWAKENED THE SLEEPING BEAUTY OF THE INSTRUMENT OF WOOD AND WIRES NEVER HAD A LESSON IN HIS LIFE
7447-91187-0026 FROM A MERE PIANO SPECIALIST LISZT ONCE SAID CHOPIN WAS THE ONLY PIANIST HE EVER KNEW THAT COULD PLAY THE VIOLIN ON THE PIANO IF HE COULD DO SO IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD HARKENED TO THE VOICE OF THE VIOLIN
7447-91187-0027 AND RESOLVED TO SHOW THAT THE PIANO TOO COULD PRODUCE THRILLING EFFECTS IN THE SAME WAY HE HAD LISTENED TO THE HUMAN VOICE AND DETERMINED THAT THE SONG OF HIS OWN INSTRUMENT SHOULD BE HEARD
7447-91187-0028 THOSE WHO GIVE EAR TO THE PIANO ALONE WILL NEVER LEARN THE SECRET OF CALLING FORTH ITS SUPREME ELOQUENCE WE CAN SEE AND HEAR THIS RAPHAEL OF MUSIC AT THE PIANO
7447-91187-0029 SO MANY AND SO ELOQUENT HAVE BEEN THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN OF HIS PLAYING IT IS EASY TO FANCY HIM SWEEPING THE IVORY KEYS WITH HIS GOSSAMER TOUCH THAT ENVELOPED WITH ETHEREAL BEAUTY
7447-91187-0030 THE MOST UNACCUSTOMED OF HIS COMPLICATED CHROMATIC MODULATIONS WE CAN FEEL HIS INDIVIDUALITY PULSATING THROUGH EVERY TONE EVOKED BY THOSE INDIVIDUALIZED FINGERS OF HIS AS THEY WEAVE MEASURES FOR SYLPHS
7447-91187-0031 WE MARVEL AT HIS SOFTLY WHISPERED YET EVER CLEARLY DISTINCT PIANISSIMO AT THE FULL ROUND TONE OF ITS RELATIVE FORTISSIMO THAT WAS NEVER HARSH OR NOISY
7447-91187-0032 AND AT ALL THE EXQUISITELY GRADED NUANCES THAT LAY BETWEEN WITH THOSE TIME FLUCTUATIONS EXPRESSIVE OF THE EBB AND FLOW OF HIS POETIC INNER BEING
7447-91187-0033 NO WONDER BALZAC MAINTAINED THAT IF CHOPIN SHOULD BUT DRUM ON THE TABLE HIS FINGERS WOULD EVOKE SUBTLE SOUNDING MUSIC AND WHAT AN EXAMPLE HE HAS LEFT FOR TEACHERS DELICATELY STRUNG AS HE WAS
7447-91187-0034 HE MUST OFTEN HAVE ENDURED TORTURES FROM THE BEST OF HIS PUPILS BUT SO THOROUGHLY WAS HE CONSECRATED TO HIS ART THAT HE NEVER FALTERED IN HIS EFFORTS TO LIFT THOSE WHO CONFIDED IN HIM
7447-91187-0035 TO THE AERIAL HEIGHTS HE HAD FOUND A VIVID PICTURE OF HIS METHOD OF TEACHING IS GIVEN IN THE LECTURES ON FREDERIC CHOPIN'S WORKS AND THEIR PROPER INTERPRETATION BY THE POLE JEAN KLECZYNSKI
7447-91187-0036 THE BASIS OF THIS METHOD CONSISTED IN REFINEMENT OF TOUCH FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF WHICH A NATURAL EASY POSITION OF THE HAND WAS CONSIDERED BY CHOPIN A PRIME REQUISITE HE PREPARED EACH HAND WITH INFINITE CARE
7447-91187-0037 BEFORE PERMITTING ANY ATTEMPT AT THE REPRODUCTION OF MUSICAL IDEAS IN ORDER TO PLACE IT TO ADVANTAGE HE CAUSED IT TO BE THROWN LIGHTLY ON THE KEYBOARD SO THAT THE FIVE FINGERS RESTED ON THE NOTES E F SHARP G SHARP A SHARP AND B
7447-91187-0038 AND WITHOUT CHANGE OF POSITION REQUIRED THE PRACTICE OF EXERCISES CALCULATED TO INSURE INDEPENDENCE THE PUPIL WAS INSTRUCTED TO GO THROUGH THESE EXERCISES FIRST STACCATO EFFECTED BY A FREE MOVEMENT OF THE WRIST
7447-91187-0039 AN ADMIRABLE MEANS OF COUNTERACTING HEAVINESS AND CLUMSINESS THEN LEGATO STACCATO THEN ACCENTED LEGATO THEN PURE LEGATO
7447-91187-0040 AND THE MOVEMENT FROM ANDANTE TO PRESTISSIMO HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY PARTICULAR ABOUT ARPEGGIO WORK AND INSISTED UPON THE REPETITION OF EVERY NOTE AND PASSAGE UNTIL ALL HARSHNESS AND ROUGHNESS OF TONE WERE ELIMINATED
7447-91187-0041 HE NEVER HESITATED ABOUT PLACING IT ON A BLACK KEY WHEN CONVENIENT AND HAD IT PASSED BY MUSCLE ACTION ALONE IN SCALES AND BROKEN CHORDS WHOSE ZEALOUS PRACTICE IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF TOUCH ACCENT RHYTHM AND TONE
7447-91187-0042 WERE DEMANDED BY HIM INDIVIDUALIZATION OF THE FINGERS WAS ONE OF HIS STRONG POINTS AND HE BELIEVED IN ASSIGNING TO EACH OF THEM ITS APPROPRIATE PART IN A GOOD MECHANISM HE SAID
7447-91187-0043 THE AIM IS NOT TO PLAY EVERYTHING WITH AN EQUAL SOUND BUT TO ACQUIRE BEAUTIFUL QUALITY OF TOUCH AND PERFECT SHADING OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN HIS EYES WAS A CLEAR ELASTIC SINGING TONE
7447-91187-0044 ONE WHOSE EXQUISITE DELICACY COULD NEVER BE CONFOUNDED WITH FEEBLENESS
7447-91187-0045 AND HE KNEW HOW TO AUGMENT THE WARMTH AND RICHNESS OF TONE COLORING BY SETTING IN VIBRATION SYMPATHETIC HARMONICS OF THE PRINCIPAL NOTES THROUGH JUDICIOUS EMPLOYMENT OF THE DAMPER PEDAL
7447-91187-0046 BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE HE ADVOCATED FREQUENT PLAYING OF THE PRELUDES AND FUGUES OF BACH AS A MEANS OF CULTIVATING MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE MUSCULAR INDEPENDENCE AND TOUCH AND TONE DISCRIMINATION HIS MUSICAL HEROES WERE BACH AND MOZART
7447-91187-0047 FOR THEY REPRESENTED TO HIM NATURE STRONG INDIVIDUALITY AND POETRY IN MUSIC AT ONE TIME HE UNDERTOOK TO WRITE A METHOD OR SCHOOL OF PIANO PLAYING BUT NEVER PROGRESSED BEYOND THE OPENING SENTENCES
7447-91187-0048 A MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN INVALUABLE TO STUDENTS AND MIGHT HAVE AVERTED MANY UNLUCKY MISAPPREHENSIONS OF HIMSELF AND HIS WORKS THOSE OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES WHO HAVE HARKENED WITH RAPTURE TO HIS PLAYING HAVE DECLARED THAT HE ALONE
7447-91187-0049 COULD ADEQUATELY INTERPRET HIS TONE CREATIONS OR MAKE PERFECTLY INTELLIGIBLE HIS METHOD PUPILS OF HIS AND THEIR PUPILS HAVE FAITHFULLY ENDEAVORED TO TRANSMIT TO THE MUSICAL WORLD THE TRADITION OF HIS INDIVIDUAL STYLE
7447-91187-0050 THE ELECT FEW HAVE COME INTO TOUCH WITH HIS VISION OF BEAUTY BUT IT HAS BEEN MERCILESSLY MISINTERPRETED BY THOUSANDS OF RUTHLESS ASPIRANTS TO MUSICAL HONORS IN THE SCHOOLROOM THE STUDENTS RECITAL AND THE CONCERT HALL
7447-91187-0051 WHOEVER PLAYS CHOPIN WITH SLEDGE HAMMER FINGERS WILL DEADEN ALL SENSE OF HIS POETRY CHARM AND GRACE WHOEVER APPROACHES HIM WITH WEAK SENTIMENTALISM WILL MISS ALTOGETHER HIS DIGNITY AND STRENGTH
7447-91187-0052 IT HAS BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT HE WAS WOMAN IN HIS TENDERNESS AND REALIZATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND MAN IN HIS ENERGY AND FORCE OF MIND THE HIGHEST TYPE OF ARTIST AND HUMAN BEING IS THUS REPRESENTED
7447-91187-0053 TO INTERPRET HIM REQUIRES SIMPLICITY PURITY OF STYLE REFINED TECHNIQUE POETIC IMAGINATION AND GENUINE SENTIMENT NOT FITFUL FICTITIOUS SENTIMENTALITY
