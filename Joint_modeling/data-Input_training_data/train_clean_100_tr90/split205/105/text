4088-158079-0002 AND AS ANOTHER MONTH OF PICKETING DREW TO AN END THE ADMINISTRATION VENTURED TO TRY OTHER WAYS TO STOP IT AND WITH IT THE CONSEQUENT EMBARRASSMENT THEIR METHODS BECAME PHYSICALLY MORE BRUTAL AND POLITICALLY MORE STUPID THEIR CONDUCT
4088-158079-0003 BECAME LAWLESS IN THE EXTREME MEANWHILE THE PRESIDENT HAD DRAFTED THE YOUNG MEN OF AMERICA IN THEIR MILLIONS TO DIE ON FOREIGN SOIL FOR FOREIGN DEMOCRACY HE HAD ISSUED A SPECIAL APPEAL TO WOMEN TO GIVE THEIR WORK THEIR TREASURE AND THEIR SONS TO THIS ENTERPRISE
4088-158079-0004 AT THE SAME TIME HIS NOW GIGANTIC FIGURE STOOD OBSTINATELY ACROSS THE PATH TO OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE IT WAS OUR DAILY TASK TO KEEP VIVIDLY IN HIS MIND THAT OBJECTIVE IT WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPEL DECISIVE ACTION FROM HIM
4088-158079-0005 TWENTY MILLION AMERICAN WOMEN ARE NOT SELF GOVERNED TAKE THE BEAM OUT OF YOUR OWN EYE WE DID NOT EXPECT PUBLIC SYMPATHY AT THIS POINT WE KNEW THAT NOT EVEN THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAD OCCASIONALLY IN DEBATE BUT MORE FREQUENTLY IN THEIR CLOAK ROOMS
4088-158079-0006 PRESIDENT AND MISSUS WILSON PASSED THROUGH THE GATES ON THEIR WAY TO A MILITARY REVIEW AT FORT MYER THE PRESIDENT SAW AMERICAN WOMEN BEING ATTACKED WHILE THE POLICE REFUSED THEM PROTECTION NOT A MOVE WAS MADE BY THE POLICE TO CONTROL THE GROWING CROWD
4088-158079-0007 SUCH INACTION IS ALWAYS A SIGNAL FOR MORE VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF ROWDIES AS THE THRONG MOVED TO AND FRO BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND OUR HEADQUARTERS IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE SO MANY BANNERS WERE DESTROYED THAT FINALLY MISS LUCY BURNS MISS VIRGINIA ARNOLD
4088-158079-0008 AND MISS ELIZABETH STUYVESANT TOOK THOSE REMAINING TO THE SECOND AND THIRD FLOOR BALCONIES OF OUR BUILDING AND HUNG THEM OUT AT THIS POINT THERE WAS NOT A PICKET LEFT ON THE STREET THE CROWD WAS CLEARLY OBSTRUCTING THE TRAFFIC BUT NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO MOVE THEM BACK OR TO PROTECT THE WOMEN
4088-158079-0009 CLIMBED UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR BALCONY MOUNTED THE IRON RAILING AND TORE DOWN ALL BANNERS AND THE AMERICAN FLAG ONE SAILOR ADMINISTERED A SEVERE BLOW IN THE FACE WITH HIS CLENCHED FIST UPON MISS GEORGINA STURGIS OF WASHINGTON WHY DID YOU DO THAT SHE DEMANDED
4088-158079-0010 AND STILL NO ATTEMPT BY THE POLICE TO QUELL THE RIOT THE CLIMAX CAME WHEN IN THE LATE AFTERNOON A BULLET WAS FIRED THROUGH ONE OF THE HEAVY GLASS WINDOWS OF THE SECOND FLOOR EMBEDDING ITSELF IN THE CEILING THE BULLET GRAZED PAST THE HEAD OF MISSUS ELLA MORTON DEAN OF MONTANA
4088-158079-0011 CAPTAIN FLATHER OF THE FIRST PRECINCT WITH TWO DETECTIVES LATER EXAMINED THE HOLES AND DECLARED THEY HAD BEEN MADE BY A THIRTY EIGHT CALIBER REVOLVER
4088-158079-0012 BUT THE POLICE LOOKED ON WHILE ALL THE BANNERS WERE DESTROYED A FEW PACES FROM HEADQUARTERS MORE BANNERS WENT OUT PURPLE WHITE AND GOLD ONES THEY TOO WERE DESTROYED BEFORE THEY REACHED THE WHITE HOUSE
4088-158079-0013 THIS ENTIRE SPECTACLE WAS ENACTED ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH WITHIN A STONE'S THROW OF THE WHITE HOUSE MISS PAUL SUMMED UP THE SITUATION WHEN SHE SAID THE SITUATION NOW EXISTING IN WASHINGTON EXISTS BECAUSE PRESIDENT WILSON PERMITS IT
4088-158079-0014 ASKING QUESTIONS MAKING BRIEF TESTIMONIALS FROM THE FLOOR WITH ALMOST EVANGELICAL FERVOR IMPROVISED COLLECTION BASKETS WERE PILED HIGH WITH BILLS WOMEN VOLUNTEERED FOR PICKET DUTY AND CERTAIN IMPRISONMENT
4088-158079-0015 AND THE FOLLOWING DAY A DELEGATION LEFT FOR WASHINGTON I CITE THIS EXPERIENCE OF MINE BECAUSE IT WAS TYPICAL EVERY ONE WHO WENT THROUGH THE COUNTRY TELLING THE STORY HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES AT THIS TIME INDIGNATION WAS SWIFT AND HOT
4088-158079-0016 OUR MASS MEETINGS EVERYWHERE BECAME MEETINGS OF PROTEST DURING THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN AND RESOLUTIONS OF PROTEST WHICH ALWAYS WENT IMMEDIATELY BY WIRE FROM SUCH MEETINGS TO THE PRESIDENT HIS CABINET AND TO HIS LEADERS IN CONGRESS OF COURSE CREATED INCREASING
4088-158079-0017 UNEASINESS IN DEMOCRATIC CIRCLES ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE PICKETS AGAIN ATTEMPTED TO TAKE THEIR POSTS ON THE LINE ON THIS DAY ONE LETTERED BANNER AND FIFTY PURPLE WHITE AND GOLD FLAGS WERE DESTROYED BY A MOB LED BY SAILORS IN UNIFORM
4088-158079-0018 BY A SAILOR WHO TOOK HER FLAG AND THEN DARTED OFF INTO THE CROWD MISS ELIZABETH STUYVESANT WAS STRUCK BY A SOLDIER IN UNIFORM AND HER BLOUSE TORN FROM HER BODY MISS MAUD JAMISON OF VIRGINIA WAS KNOCKED DOWN AND DRAGGED ALONG THE SIDEWALK
412-126975-0000 THE FLYING STARS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CRIME I EVER COMMITTED FLAMBEAU WOULD SAY IN HIS HIGHLY MORAL OLD AGE
412-126975-0001 WAS ALSO BY A SINGULAR COINCIDENCE MY LAST IT WAS COMMITTED AT CHRISTMAS AS AN ARTIST
412-126975-0002 I HAD ALWAYS ATTEMPTED TO PROVIDE CRIMES SUITABLE TO THE SPECIAL SEASON OR LANDSCAPES IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF CHOOSING THIS OR THAT TERRACE OR GARDEN FOR A CATASTROPHE AS IF FOR A STATUARY GROUP
412-126975-0003 THUS SQUIRES SHOULD BE SWINDLED IN LONG ROOMS PANELLED WITH OAK WHILE JEWS ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD RATHER FIND THEMSELVES UNEXPECTEDLY PENNILESS
412-126975-0004 AMONG THE LIGHTS AND SCREENS OF THE CAFE RICHE THUS IN ENGLAND IF I WISHED TO RELIEVE A DEAN OF HIS RICHES WHICH IS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE I WISHED TO FRAME HIM
412-126975-0005 IF I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR IN THE GREEN LAWNS AND GREY TOWERS OF SOME CATHEDRAL TOWN SIMILARLY IN FRANCE WHEN I HAD GOT MONEY OUT OF A RICH AND WICKED PEASANT
412-126975-0006 WHICH IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IT GRATIFIED ME TO GET HIS INDIGNANT HEAD RELIEVED AGAINST A GREY LINE OF CLIPPED POPLARS AND THOSE SOLEMN PLAINS OF GAUL OVER WHICH BROODS THE MIGHTY SPIRIT OF MILLET
412-126975-0007 WELL MY LAST CRIME WAS A CHRISTMAS CRIME A CHEERY COSY ENGLISH MIDDLE CLASS CRIME A CRIME OF CHARLES DICKENS
412-126975-0008 I DID IT IN A GOOD OLD MIDDLE CLASS HOUSE NEAR PUTNEY A HOUSE WITH A CRESCENT OF CARRIAGE DRIVE A HOUSE WITH A STABLE BY THE SIDE OF IT A HOUSE WITH THE NAME ON THE TWO OUTER GATES
412-126975-0009 A HOUSE WITH A MONKEY TREE ENOUGH YOU KNOW THE SPECIES I REALLY THINK MY IMITATION OF DICKENS'S STYLE WAS DEXTEROUS AND LITERARY IT SEEMS ALMOST A PITY
412-126975-0010 I REPENTED THE SAME EVENING FLAMBEAU WOULD THEN PROCEED TO TELL THE STORY FROM THE INSIDE AND EVEN FROM THE INSIDE IT WAS ODD SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE
412-126975-0011 IT WAS PERFECTLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND IT IS FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT THE STRANGER MUST STUDY IT FROM THIS STANDPOINT THE DRAMA MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BEGUN WHEN THE FRONT DOORS OF THE HOUSE WITH THE STABLE
412-126975-0012 OPENED ON THE GARDEN WITH THE MONKEY TREE AND A YOUNG GIRL CAME OUT WITH BREAD TO FEED THE BIRDS ON THE AFTERNOON OF BOXING DAY SHE HAD A PRETTY FACE WITH BRAVE BROWN EYES
412-126975-0013 BUT HER FIGURE WAS BEYOND CONJECTURE FOR SHE WAS SO WRAPPED UP IN BROWN FURS THAT IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHICH WAS HAIR AND WHICH WAS FUR BUT FOR THE ATTRACTIVE FACE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SMALL TODDLING BEAR
412-126975-0014 THE WINTER AFTERNOON WAS REDDENING TOWARDS EVENING AND ALREADY A RUBY LIGHT WAS ROLLED OVER THE BLOOMLESS BEDS FILLING THEM AS IT WERE WITH THE GHOSTS OF THE DEAD ROSES
412-126975-0015 ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE STOOD THE STABLE ON THE OTHER AN ALLEY OR CLOISTER OF LAURELS LED TO THE LARGER GARDEN BEHIND THE YOUNG LADY HAVING SCATTERED BREAD FOR THE BIRDS
412-126975-0016 FOR THE FOURTH OR FIFTH TIME THAT DAY BECAUSE THE DOG ATE IT PASSED UNOBTRUSIVELY DOWN THE LANE OF LAURELS AND INTO A GLIMMERING PLANTATION OF EVERGREENS BEHIND
412-126975-0017 HERE SHE GAVE AN EXCLAMATION OF WONDER REAL OR RITUAL AND LOOKING UP AT THE HIGH GARDEN WALL ABOVE HER BEHELD IT FANTASTICALLY BESTRIDDEN BY A SOMEWHAT FANTASTIC FIGURE
412-126975-0018 OH DON'T JUMP MISTER CROOK SHE CALLED OUT IN SOME ALARM IT'S MUCH TOO HIGH THE INDIVIDUAL RIDING THE PARTY WALL LIKE AN AERIAL HORSE
412-126975-0019 WAS A TALL ANGULAR YOUNG MAN WITH DARK HAIR STICKING UP LIKE A HAIR BRUSH INTELLIGENT AND EVEN DISTINGUISHED LINEAMENTS BUT A SALLOW AND ALMOST ALIEN COMPLEXION
412-126975-0020 THIS SHOWED THE MORE PLAINLY BECAUSE HE WORE AN AGGRESSIVE RED TIE THE ONLY PART OF HIS COSTUME OF WHICH HE SEEMED TO TAKE ANY CARE PERHAPS IT WAS A SYMBOL
412-126975-0021 HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE GIRL'S ALARMED ADJURATION BUT LEAPT LIKE A GRASSHOPPER TO THE GROUND BESIDE HER WHERE HE MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BROKEN HIS LEGS I THINK I WAS MEANT TO BE A BURGLAR
412-126975-0022 HE SAID PLACIDLY AND I HAVE NO DOUBT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IF I HADN'T HAPPENED TO BE BORN IN THAT NICE HOUSE NEXT DOOR I CAN'T SEE ANY HARM IN IT ANYHOW
412-126975-0023 HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH THINGS SHE REMONSTRATED WELL SAID THE YOUNG MAN IF YOU'RE BORN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE WALL I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S WRONG TO CLIMB OVER IT
412-126975-0024 I NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU WILL SAY OR DO NEXT SHE SAID I DON'T OFTEN KNOW MYSELF REPLIED MISTER CROOK BUT THEN I AM ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WALL NOW
412-126975-0025 AND WHICH IS THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WALL ASKED THE YOUNG LADY SMILING WHICHEVER SIDE YOU ARE ON SAID THE YOUNG MAN NAMED CROOK
412-126975-0026 AS THEY WENT TOGETHER THROUGH THE LAURELS TOWARDS THE FRONT GARDEN A MOTOR HORN SOUNDED THRICE COMING NEARER AND NEARER AND A CAR OF SPLENDID SPEED GREAT ELEGANCE
412-126975-0027 AND STOOD THROBBING HULLO HULLO SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE RED TIE HERE'S SOMEBODY BORN ON THE RIGHT SIDE ANYHOW I DIDN'T KNOW MISS ADAMS THAT YOUR SANTA CLAUS WAS SO MODERN AS THIS
412-126975-0028 OH THAT'S MY GODFATHER SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER HE ALWAYS COMES ON BOXING DAY THEN AFTER AN INNOCENT PAUSE WHICH UNCONSCIOUSLY BETRAYED SOME LACK OF ENTHUSIASM
412-126975-0029 RUBY ADAMS ADDED HE IS VERY KIND JOHN CROOK JOURNALIST HAD HEARD OF THAT EMINENT CITY MAGNATE AND IT WAS NOT HIS FAULT IF THE CITY MAGNATE
412-126975-0030 HAD NOT HEARD OF HIM FOR IN CERTAIN ARTICLES IN THE CLARION OR THE NEW AGE SIR LEOPOLD HAD BEEN DEALT WITH AUSTERELY BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND GRIMLY WATCHED THE UNLOADING OF THE MOTOR CAR
412-126975-0031 WHICH WAS RATHER A LONG PROCESS A LARGE NEAT CHAUFFEUR IN GREEN GOT OUT FROM THE FRONT AND A SMALL NEAT MANSERVANT IN GREY GOT OUT FROM THE BACK AND BETWEEN THEM THEY DEPOSITED SIR LEOPOLD ON THE DOORSTEP
412-126975-0032 AND BEGAN TO UNPACK HIM LIKE SOME VERY CAREFULLY PROTECTED PARCEL RUGS ENOUGH TO STOCK A BAZAAR FURS OF ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST AND SCARVES OF ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
412-126975-0033 WERE UNWRAPPED ONE BY ONE TILL THEY REVEALED SOMETHING RESEMBLING THE HUMAN FORM THE FORM OF A FRIENDLY BUT FOREIGN LOOKING OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A GREY GOAT LIKE BEARD AND A BEAMING SMILE
412-126975-0034 WHO RUBBED HIS BIG FUR GLOVES TOGETHER LONG BEFORE THIS REVELATION WAS COMPLETE THE TWO BIG DOORS OF THE PORCH HAD OPENED IN THE MIDDLE AND COLONEL ADAMS FATHER OF THE FURRY YOUNG LADY
412-126975-0035 HAD COME OUT HIMSELF TO INVITE HIS EMINENT GUEST INSIDE HE WAS A TALL SUNBURNT AND VERY SILENT MAN WHO WORE A RED SMOKING CAP LIKE A FEZ MAKING HIM LOOK LIKE ONE OF THE ENGLISH SIRDARS
412-126975-0036 OR PASHAS IN EGYPT WITH HIM WAS HIS BROTHER IN LAW LATELY COME FROM CANADA A BIG AND RATHER BOISTEROUS YOUNG GENTLEMAN FARMER WITH A YELLOW BEARD BY NAME JAMES BLOUNT
412-126975-0037 WITH HIM ALSO WAS THE MORE INSIGNIFICANT FIGURE OF THE PRIEST FROM THE NEIGHBOURING ROMAN CHURCH FOR THE COLONEL'S LATE WIFE HAD BEEN A CATHOLIC AND THE CHILDREN AS IS COMMON IN SUCH CASES HAD BEEN TRAINED TO FOLLOW HER
412-126975-0038 EVERYTHING SEEMED UNDISTINGUISHED ABOUT THE PRIEST EVEN DOWN TO HIS NAME WHICH WAS BROWN YET THE COLONEL HAD ALWAYS FOUND SOMETHING COMPANIONABLE ABOUT HIM AND FREQUENTLY ASKED HIM TO SUCH FAMILY GATHERINGS
412-126975-0039 IN THE LARGE ENTRANCE HALL OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS AMPLE ROOM EVEN FOR SIR LEOPOLD AND THE REMOVAL OF HIS WRAPS PORCH AND VESTIBULE INDEED
412-126975-0040 WERE UNDULY LARGE IN PROPORTION TO THE HOUSE AND FORMED AS IT WERE A BIG ROOM WITH THE FRONT DOOR AT ONE END AND THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE AT THE OTHER IN FRONT OF THE LARGE HALL FIRE
412-126975-0041 OVER WHICH HUNG THE COLONEL'S SWORD THE PROCESS WAS COMPLETED AND THE COMPANY INCLUDING THE SATURNINE CROOK PRESENTED TO SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER THAT VENERABLE FINANCIER HOWEVER
412-126975-0042 STILL SEEMED STRUGGLING WITH PORTIONS OF HIS WELL LINED ATTIRE AND AT LENGTH PRODUCED FROM A VERY INTERIOR TAIL COAT POCKET A BLACK OVAL CASE WHICH HE RADIANTLY EXPLAINED TO BE HIS CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR HIS GOD DAUGHTER
412-126975-0043 WITH AN UNAFFECTED VAIN GLORY THAT HAD SOMETHING DISARMING ABOUT IT HE HELD OUT THE CASE BEFORE THEM ALL IT FLEW OPEN AT A TOUCH AND HALF BLINDED THEM
412-126975-0044 IT WAS JUST AS IF A CRYSTAL FOUNTAIN HAD SPURTED IN THEIR EYES IN A NEST OF ORANGE VELVET LAY LIKE THREE EGGS THREE WHITE AND VIVID DIAMONDS THAT SEEMED TO SET THE VERY AIR ON FIRE ALL ROUND THEM
412-126975-0045 FISCHER STOOD BEAMING BENEVOLENTLY AND DRINKING DEEP OF THE ASTONISHMENT AND ECSTASY OF THE GIRL THE GRIM ADMIRATION AND GRUFF THANKS OF THE COLONEL THE WONDER OF THE WHOLE GROUP
412-126975-0046 I HAD TO BE CAREFUL OF EM COMING DOWN THEY'RE THE THREE GREAT AFRICAN DIAMONDS CALLED THE FLYING STARS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN STOLEN SO OFTEN ALL THE BIG CRIMINALS ARE ON THE TRACK
412-126975-0047 BUT EVEN THE ROUGH MEN ABOUT IN THE STREETS AND HOTELS COULD HARDLY HAVE KEPT THEIR HANDS OFF THEM I MIGHT HAVE LOST THEM ON THE ROAD HERE IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE QUITE NATURAL I SHOULD SAY
412-126975-0048 GROWLED THE MAN IN THE RED TIE I SHOULDN'T BLAME EM IF THEY HAD TAKEN EM WHEN THEY ASK FOR BREAD AND YOU DON'T EVEN GIVE THEM A STONE I THINK THEY MIGHT TAKE THE STONE FOR THEMSELVES

412-126975-0050 A SAINT SAID FATHER BROWN I THINK SAID SIR LEOPOLD WITH A SUPERCILIOUS SMILE THAT RUBY MEANS A SOCIALIST
412-126975-0051 A RADICAL DOES NOT MEAN A MAN WHO LIVES ON RADISHES REMARKED CROOK WITH SOME IMPATIENCE AND A CONSERVATIVE DOES NOT MEAN A MAN WHO PRESERVES JAM NEITHER I ASSURE YOU
412-126975-0052 DOES A SOCIALIST MEAN A MAN WHO DESIRES A SOCIAL EVENING WITH THE CHIMNEY SWEEP A SOCIALIST MEANS A MAN WHO WANTS ALL THE CHIMNEYS SWEPT AND ALL THE CHIMNEY SWEEPS PAID FOR IT BUT WHO WON'T ALLOW YOU
412-126975-0053 PUT IN THE PRIEST IN A LOW VOICE TO OWN YOUR OWN SOOT CROOK LOOKED AT HIM WITH AN EYE OF INTEREST AND EVEN RESPECT DOES ONE WANT TO OWN SOOT HE ASKED ONE MIGHT

412-126975-0065 DON'T LET'S QUARREL THERE ARE LOWER JOKES THAN SITTING ON A TOP HAT DISLIKE OF THE RED TIED YOUTH BORN OF HIS PREDATORY OPINIONS AND EVIDENT INTIMACY WITH THE PRETTY GODCHILD
412-126975-0066 LED FISCHER TO SAY IN HIS MOST SARCASTIC MAGISTERIAL MANNER NO DOUBT YOU HAVE FOUND SOMETHING MUCH LOWER THAN SITTING ON A TOP HAT WHAT IS IT PRAY
