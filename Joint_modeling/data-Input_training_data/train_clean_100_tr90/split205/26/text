1743-142914-0012 HE WAS QUITE A LITTLE BIGGER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS TAIL WAS SHORT HIS LEGS WERE SHORT AND HIS NECK WAS SHORT BUT HIS BILL WAS LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE UP
1743-142914-0013 HIS BACK WAS A MIXTURE OF GRAY BROWN BLACK AND BUFF WHILE HIS BREAST AND UNDER PARTS WERE A BEAUTIFUL REDDISH BUFF IT WAS HIS HEAD THAT MADE HIM LOOK QUEER
1743-142914-0014 HIS EYES WERE VERY BIG AND THEY WERE SET SO FAR BACK THAT PETER WONDERED IF IT WASN'T EASIER FOR HIM TO LOOK BEHIND HIM THAN IN FRONT OF HIM SUDDENLY LONGBILL PLUNGED HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND HE PLUNGED IT IN FOR THE WHOLE LENGTH
1743-142914-0015 THEN HE PULLED IT OUT AND PETER CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TAIL END OF A WORM DISAPPEARING DOWN LONGBILL'S THROAT WHERE THAT LONG BILL HAD GONE INTO THE GROUND WAS A NEAT LITTLE ROUND HOLE
1743-142914-0016 FOR THE FIRST TIME PETER NOTICED THAT THERE WERE MANY SUCH LITTLE ROUND HOLES ALL ABOUT DID YOU MAKE ALL THOSE LITTLE ROUND HOLES EXCLAIMED PETER
1743-142914-0017 AND WAS THERE A WORM IN EVERY ONE ASKED PETER HIS EYES VERY WIDE WITH INTEREST LONGBILL NODDED
1743-142914-0018 PETER REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD WATCHED WELCOME ROBIN LISTEN AND THEN SUDDENLY PLUNGE HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND AND PULL OUT A WORM BUT THE WORMS WELCOME ROBIN GOT WERE ALWAYS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
1743-142914-0019 WHILE THESE WORMS WERE SO DEEP IN THE EARTH THAT PETER COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE THERE
1743-142914-0020 AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO OPEN YOUR BILL DOWN THERE TO TAKE HIM IN ASKED PETER LONGBILL CHUCKLED
1743-142914-0021 LONGBILL SUDDENLY THRUST HIS BILL STRAIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF HIM AND TO PETER'S ASTONISHMENT HE LIFTED THE END OF THE UPPER HALF WITHOUT OPENING THE REST OF HIS BILL AT ALL THAT'S THE WAY I GET THEM SAID HE
1743-142914-0022 I THINK THERE IS ONE RIGHT UNDER MY FEET NOW WATCH ME GET HIM LONGBILL BORED INTO THE GROUND UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS ALMOST AGAINST IT WHEN HE PULLED HIS BILL OUT SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A WORM OF COURSE EXPLAINED LONGBILL IT IS ONLY IN SOFT GROUND THAT I CAN DO THIS
1743-142914-0023 THAT IS WHY I HAVE TO FLY AWAY SOUTH AS SOON AS THE GROUND FREEZES AT ALL IT'S WONDERFUL SIGHED PETER I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY ONE ELSE CAN FIND HIDDEN WORMS THAT WAY MY COUSIN JACK SNIPE CAN REPLIED LONGBILL PROMPTLY
1743-142914-0024 HE FEEDS THE SAME WAY I DO ONLY HE LIKES MARSHY MEADOWS INSTEAD OF BRUSHY SWAMPS PERHAPS YOU KNOW HIM PETER NODDED I DO SAID HE NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT THERE IS A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE ALTHOUGH I HADN'T THOUGHT OF HIM AS A RELATIVE OF YOURS BEFORE
1743-142914-0025 NOW I MUST BE RUNNING ALONG I'M EVER SO GLAD TO HAVE SEEN YOU AND I'M COMING OVER TO CALL AGAIN THE FIRST CHANCE I GET SO PETER SAID GOOD BY AND KEPT ON DOWN THE LAUGHING BROOK TO THE SMILING POOL RIGHT WHERE THE LAUGHING BROOK ENTERED THE SMILING POOL
1743-142914-0026 THERE WAS A LITTLE PEBBLY BEACH RUNNING ALONG THE VERY EDGE OF THE WATER WAS A SLIM TRIM LITTLE BIRD WITH FAIRLY LONG LEGS A LONG SLENDER BILL BROWNISH GRAY BACK WITH BLACK SPOTS AND MARKINGS AND A WHITE WAISTCOAT NEATLY SPOTTED WITH BLACK
1743-142914-0027 EVERY FEW STEPS HE WOULD STOP TO PICK UP SOMETHING THEN STAND FOR A SECOND BOBBING UP AND DOWN IN THE FUNNIEST WAY AS IF HIS BODY WAS SO NICELY BALANCED ON HIS LEGS THAT IT TEETERED BACK AND FORTH LIKE A SEESAW
1743-142914-0028 IT WAS TEETER THE SPOTTED SANDPIPER AN OLD FRIEND OF PETER'S PETER GREETED HIM JOYOUSLY
1743-142914-0029 BEFORE PETER COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD TEETER CAME RUNNING TOWARDS HIM AND IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT TEETER WAS VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING DON'T MOVE PETER RABBIT DON'T MOVE HE CRIED WHY NOT DEMANDED PETER FOR HE COULD SEE NO DANGER AND COULD THINK OF NO REASON WHY HE SHOULDN'T MOVE
1743-142914-0030 JUST THEN MISSUS TEETER CAME HURRYING UP AND SQUATTED DOWN IN THE SAND RIGHT IN FRONT OF PETER THANK GOODNESS EXCLAIMED TEETER STILL BOBBING AND BOWING IF YOU HAD TAKEN ANOTHER STEP PETER RABBIT YOU WOULD HAVE STEPPED RIGHT ON OUR EGGS YOU GAVE ME A DREADFUL START
1743-142914-0031 MISSUS TEETER STOOD UP AND STEPPED ASIDE THEN PETER SAW RIGHT IN A LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE SAND WITH JUST A FEW BITS OF GRASS FOR A LINING FOUR WHITE EGGS WITH BIG DARK BLOTCHES ON THEM
1743-142914-0032 THEY LOOKED SO MUCH LIKE THE SURROUNDING PEBBLES THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM IN THE WORLD BUT FOR MISSUS TEETER PETER HASTILY BACKED AWAY A FEW STEPS MISSUS TEETER SLIPPED BACK ON THE EGGS AND SETTLED HERSELF COMFORTABLY
1743-142914-0033 IT SUDDENLY STRUCK PETER THAT IF HE HADN'T SEEN HER DO IT HE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN SHE WAS THERE
1743-142914-0034 MY HE EXCLAIMED I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE STEPPED ON THOSE EGGS IF YOU HADN'T WARNED ME SAID HE I'M SO THANKFUL I DIDN'T I DON'T SEE HOW YOU DARE LAY THEM IN THE OPEN LIKE THIS
19-198-0000 NORTHANGER ABBEY
19-198-0001 THIS LITTLE WORK WAS FINISHED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN O THREE AND INTENDED FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION IT WAS DISPOSED OF TO A BOOKSELLER IT WAS EVEN ADVERTISED
19-198-0002 NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE
19-198-0003 THE PUBLIC ARE ENTREATED TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE IT WAS FINISHED MANY MORE SINCE IT WAS BEGUN AND THAT DURING THAT PERIOD PLACES MANNERS BOOKS AND OPINIONS HAVE UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE CHANGES
19-198-0004 CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
19-198-0005 THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER HER OWN PERSON AND DISPOSITION WERE ALL EQUALLY AGAINST HER HER FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN WITHOUT BEING NEGLECTED OR POOR AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN
19-198-0006 HER MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF USEFUL PLAIN SENSE WITH A GOOD TEMPER AND WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE WITH A GOOD CONSTITUTION SHE HAD THREE SONS BEFORE CATHERINE WAS BORN
19-198-0007 WHERE THERE ARE HEADS AND ARMS AND LEGS ENOUGH FOR THE NUMBER BUT THE MORLANDS HAD LITTLE OTHER RIGHT TO THE WORD FOR THEY WERE IN GENERAL VERY PLAIN AND CATHERINE FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE AS PLAIN AS ANY
19-198-0008 SHE HAD A THIN AWKWARD FIGURE
19-198-0009 DARK LANK HAIR AND STRONG FEATURES SO MUCH FOR HER PERSON AND NOT LESS UNPROPITIOUS FOR HEROISM SEEMED HER MIND SHE WAS FOND OF ALL BOY'S PLAYS AND GREATLY PREFERRED CRICKET
19-198-0010 NOT MERELY TO DOLLS BUT TO THE MORE HEROIC ENJOYMENTS OF INFANCY NURSING A DORMOUSE FEEDING A CANARY BIRD OR WATERING A ROSE BUSH INDEED SHE HAD NO TASTE FOR A GARDEN
19-198-0011 AND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES
19-198-0012 HER ABILITIES WERE QUITE AS EXTRAORDINARY SHE NEVER COULD LEARN OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BEFORE SHE WAS TAUGHT AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THEN FOR SHE WAS OFTEN INATTENTIVE AND OCCASIONALLY STUPID
19-198-0013 HER MOTHER WAS THREE MONTHS IN TEACHING HER ONLY TO REPEAT THE BEGGAR'S PETITION AND AFTER ALL HER NEXT SISTER SALLY COULD SAY IT BETTER THAN SHE DID NOT THAT CATHERINE WAS ALWAYS STUPID BY NO MEANS
19-198-0014 SHE LEARNT THE FABLE OF THE HARE AND MANY FRIENDS AS QUICKLY AS ANY GIRL IN ENGLAND HER MOTHER WISHED HER TO LEARN MUSIC AND CATHERINE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD LIKE IT FOR SHE WAS VERY FOND OF TINKLING THE KEYS OF THE OLD FORLORN SPINNET
19-198-0015 SO AT EIGHT YEARS OLD SHE BEGAN SHE LEARNT A YEAR AND COULD NOT BEAR IT AND MISSUS MORLAND WHO DID NOT INSIST ON HER DAUGHTERS BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN SPITE OF INCAPACITY OR DISTASTE ALLOWED HER TO LEAVE OFF
19-198-0016 FRENCH BY HER MOTHER HER PROFICIENCY IN EITHER WAS NOT REMARKABLE AND SHE SHIRKED HER LESSONS IN BOTH WHENEVER SHE COULD WHAT A STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE CHARACTER FOR WITH ALL THESE SYMPTOMS OF PROFLIGACY AT TEN YEARS OLD
19-198-0017 HATED CONFINEMENT AND CLEANLINESS AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN AT FIFTEEN APPEARANCES WERE MENDING
19-198-0018 SHE BEGAN TO CURL HER HAIR AND LONG FOR BALLS HER COMPLEXION IMPROVED HER FEATURES WERE SOFTENED BY PLUMPNESS AND COLOUR HER EYES GAINED MORE ANIMATION AND HER FIGURE MORE CONSEQUENCE
19-198-0019 HER LOVE OF DIRT GAVE WAY TO AN INCLINATION FOR FINERY AND SHE GREW CLEAN AS SHE GREW SMART SHE HAD NOW THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES HEARING HER FATHER AND MOTHER REMARK ON HER PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT
19-198-0020 CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY
19-198-0021 THAN A BEAUTY FROM HER CRADLE CAN EVER RECEIVE MISSUS MORLAND WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN AND WISHED TO SEE HER CHILDREN EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE BUT HER TIME WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED IN LYING IN AND TEACHING THE LITTLE ONES
19-198-0022 THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACK
19-198-0023 AND RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO BOOKS OR AT LEAST BOOKS OF INFORMATION FOR PROVIDED THAT NOTHING LIKE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE COULD BE GAINED FROM THEM PROVIDED THEY WERE ALL STORY AND NO REFLECTION
19-198-0024 SHE HAD NEVER ANY OBJECTION TO BOOKS AT ALL BUT FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SHE WAS IN TRAINING FOR A HEROINE SHE READ ALL SUCH WORKS AS HEROINES MUST READ TO SUPPLY THEIR MEMORIES WITH THOSE QUOTATIONS WHICH ARE SO SERVICEABLE
19-198-0025 MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR FROM THOMPSON THAT IT IS A DELIGHTFUL TASK TO TEACH THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOT
19-198-0026 AND FROM SHAKESPEARE SHE GAINED A GREAT STORE OF INFORMATION AMONGST THE REST THAT TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR ARE TO THE JEALOUS CONFIRMATION STRONG AS PROOFS OF HOLY WRIT
19-198-0027 THAT THE POOR BEETLE WHICH WE TREAD UPON IN CORPORAL SUFFERANCE FEELS A PANG AS GREAT AS WHEN A GIANT DIES AND THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IN LOVE ALWAYS LOOKS
19-198-0028 LIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT SMILING AT GRIEF SO FAR HER IMPROVEMENT WAS SUFFICIENT AND IN MANY OTHER POINTS SHE CAME ON EXCEEDINGLY WELL FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT WRITE SONNETS
19-198-0029 SHE BROUGHT HERSELF TO READ THEM AND THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF HER THROWING A WHOLE PARTY INTO RAPTURES BY A PRELUDE ON THE PIANOFORTE OF HER OWN COMPOSITION SHE COULD LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE WITH VERY LITTLE FATIGUE
19-198-0030 HER GREATEST DEFICIENCY WAS IN THE PENCIL SHE HAD NO NOTION OF DRAWING NOT ENOUGH EVEN TO ATTEMPT A SKETCH OF HER LOVER'S PROFILE THAT SHE MIGHT BE DETECTED IN THE DESIGN
19-198-0031 THERE SHE FELL MISERABLY SHORT OF THE TRUE HEROIC HEIGHT AT PRESENT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER OWN POVERTY FOR SHE HAD NO LOVER TO PORTRAY SHE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN
19-198-0032 WITHOUT HAVING SEEN ONE AMIABLE YOUTH WHO COULD CALL FORTH HER SENSIBILITY WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED ONE REAL PASSION AND WITHOUT HAVING EXCITED EVEN ANY ADMIRATION BUT WHAT WAS VERY MODERATE AND VERY TRANSIENT
19-198-0033 THIS WAS STRANGE INDEED BUT STRANGE THINGS MAY BE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR IF THEIR CAUSE BE FAIRLY SEARCHED OUT THERE WAS NOT ONE LORD IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NO NOT EVEN A BARONET
19-198-0034 THERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDREN
19-198-0035 BUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY MISTER ALLEN
19-198-0036 WHO OWNED THE CHIEF OF THE PROPERTY ABOUT FULLERTON THE VILLAGE IN WILTSHIRE WHERE THE MORLANDS LIVED WAS ORDERED TO BATH FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GOUTY CONSTITUTION AND HIS LADY A GOOD HUMOURED WOMAN FOND OF MISS MORLAND AND PROBABLY AWARE THAT IF
19-198-0037 SHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEM
19-227-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY CATHERINE'S DISPOSITION WAS NOT NATURALLY SEDENTARY NOR HAD HER HABITS BEEN EVER VERY INDUSTRIOUS BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HITHERTO HAVE BEEN HER DEFECTS OF THAT SORT
19-227-0001 HER MOTHER COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THEM NOW TO BE GREATLY INCREASED SHE COULD NEITHER SIT STILL NOR EMPLOY HERSELF FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER WALKING ROUND THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF NOTHING BUT MOTION WAS VOLUNTARY
19-227-0002 AND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD EVEN WALK ABOUT THE HOUSE RATHER THAN REMAIN FIXED FOR ANY TIME IN THE PARLOUR HER LOSS OF SPIRITS WAS A YET GREATER ALTERATION IN HER RAMBLING AND HER IDLENESS
19-227-0003 BUT WHEN A THIRD NIGHT'S REST HAD NEITHER RESTORED HER CHEERFULNESS IMPROVED HER IN USEFUL ACTIVITY NOR GIVEN HER A GREATER INCLINATION FOR NEEDLEWORK SHE COULD NO LONGER REFRAIN FROM THE GENTLE REPROOF OF
19-227-0004 MY DEAR CATHERINE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GROWING QUITE A FINE LADY I DO NOT KNOW WHEN POOR RICHARD'S CRAVATS WOULD BE DONE IF HE HAD NO FRIEND BUT YOU YOUR HEAD RUNS TOO MUCH UPON BATH
19-227-0005 CATHERINE TOOK UP HER WORK DIRECTLY SAYING IN A DEJECTED VOICE THAT HER HEAD DID NOT RUN UPON BATH MUCH THEN YOU ARE FRETTING ABOUT GENERAL TILNEY AND THAT IS VERY SIMPLE OF YOU
19-227-0006 FOR TEN TO ONE WHETHER YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN YOU SHOULD NEVER FRET ABOUT TRIFLES AFTER A SHORT SILENCE I HOPE MY CATHERINE YOU ARE NOT GETTING OUT OF HUMOUR WITH HOME BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO GRAND AS NORTHANGER
19-227-0007 THAT WOULD BE TURNING YOUR VISIT INTO AN EVIL INDEED WHEREVER YOU ARE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONTENTED BUT ESPECIALLY AT HOME BECAUSE THERE YOU MUST SPEND THE MOST OF YOUR TIME I DID NOT QUITE LIKE AT BREAKFAST
19-227-0008 TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT NORTHANGER I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT I EAT THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH SUCH A SUBJECT
19-227-0009 ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOILT FOR HOME BY GREAT ACQUAINTANCE THE MIRROR I THINK I WILL LOOK IT OUT FOR YOU SOME DAY OR OTHER BECAUSE I AM SURE IT WILL DO YOU GOOD CATHERINE SAID NO MORE AND WITH AN ENDEAVOUR TO DO RIGHT
19-227-0010 APPLIED TO HER WORK BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES SUNK AGAIN WITHOUT KNOWING IT HERSELF INTO LANGUOR AND LISTLESSNESS MOVING HERSELF IN HER CHAIR FROM THE IRRITATION OF WEARINESS MUCH OFTENER THAN SHE MOVED HER NEEDLE
19-227-0011 HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER
19-227-0012 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED ERE SHE RETURNED DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE VOLUME FROM WHICH SO MUCH WAS HOPED HER AVOCATIONS ABOVE HAVING SHUT OUT ALL NOISE BUT WHAT SHE CREATED HERSELF
19-227-0013 SHE KNEW NOT THAT A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES TILL ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST OBJECT SHE BEHELD WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
19-227-0014 WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER AS MISTER HENRY TILNEY WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY
19-227-0015 BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS APPEARANCE THERE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED HE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO EXPECT A WELCOME AT FULLERTON AND STATING HIS IMPATIENCE TO BE ASSURED OF MISS MORLAND'S HAVING REACHED HER HOME IN SAFETY
19-227-0016 AS THE CAUSE OF HIS INTRUSION HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIMSELF TO AN UNCANDID JUDGE OR A RESENTFUL HEART FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HIM OR HIS SISTER IN THEIR FATHER'S MISCONDUCT
19-227-0017 MISSUS MORLAND HAD BEEN ALWAYS KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS EACH AND INSTANTLY PLEASED BY HIS APPEARANCE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE SIMPLE PROFESSIONS OF UNAFFECTED BENEVOLENCE THANKING HIM FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION TO HER DAUGHTER
19-227-0018 THOUGH HIS HEART WAS GREATLY RELIEVED BY SUCH UNLOOKED FOR MILDNESS IT WAS NOT JUST AT THAT MOMENT IN HIS POWER TO SAY ANYTHING TO THE PURPOSE RETURNING IN SILENCE TO HIS SEAT THEREFORE
19-227-0019 BUT HER GLOWING CHEEK AND BRIGHTENED EYE MADE HER MOTHER TRUST THAT THIS GOOD NATURED VISIT WOULD AT LEAST SET HER HEART AT EASE FOR A TIME AND GLADLY THEREFORE DID SHE LAY ASIDE THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE MIRROR FOR A FUTURE HOUR
19-227-0020 DESIROUS OF MISTER MORLAND'S ASSISTANCE AS WELL IN GIVING ENCOURAGEMENT AS IN FINDING CONVERSATION FOR HER GUEST WHOSE EMBARRASSMENT ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT SHE EARNESTLY PITIED
19-227-0021 MISSUS MORLAND HAD VERY EARLY DISPATCHED ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO SUMMON HIM BUT MISTER MORLAND WAS FROM HOME AND BEING THUS WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
19-227-0022 AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES UNBROKEN SILENCE HENRY TURNING TO CATHERINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HER MOTHER'S ENTRANCE ASKED HER WITH SUDDEN ALACRITY IF MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN WERE NOW AT FULLERTON
19-227-0023 AND ON DEVELOPING FROM AMIDST ALL HER PERPLEXITY OF WORDS IN REPLY THE MEANING WHICH ONE SHORT SYLLABLE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO THEM AND
19-227-0024 ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW HIM THE WAY YOU MAY SEE THE HOUSE FROM THIS WINDOW SIR WAS INFORMATION ON SARAH'S SIDE WHICH PRODUCED ONLY A BOW OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE GENTLEMAN AND A SILENCING NOD FROM HER MOTHER
19-227-0025 FOR MISSUS MORLAND THINKING IT PROBABLE AS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IN HIS WISH OF WAITING ON THEIR WORTHY NEIGHBOURS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO GIVE OF HIS FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR
19-227-0026 WHICH IT MUST BE MORE PLEASANT FOR HIM TO COMMUNICATE ONLY TO CATHERINE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PREVENT HER ACCOMPANYING HIM THEY BEGAN THEIR WALK AND MISSUS MORLAND WAS NOT ENTIRELY MISTAKEN IN HIS OBJECT IN WISHING IT
19-227-0027 SOME EXPLANATION ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT HE HAD TO GIVE BUT HIS FIRST PURPOSE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND BEFORE THEY REACHED MISTER ALLEN'S GROUNDS HE HAD DONE IT SO WELL THAT CATHERINE DID NOT THINK IT COULD EVER BE REPEATED TOO OFTEN
19-227-0028 AND DELIGHTED IN ALL THE EXCELLENCIES OF HER CHARACTER AND TRULY LOVED HER SOCIETY I MUST CONFESS THAT HIS AFFECTION ORIGINATED IN NOTHING BETTER THAN GRATITUDE OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT A PERSUASION OF HER PARTIALITY FOR HIM
19-227-0029 HAD BEEN THE ONLY CAUSE OF GIVING HER A SERIOUS THOUGHT IT IS A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE IN ROMANCE I ACKNOWLEDGE AND DREADFULLY DEROGATORY OF AN HEROINE'S DIGNITY BUT IF IT BE AS NEW IN COMMON LIFE
19-227-0030 THE CREDIT OF A WILD IMAGINATION WILL AT LEAST BE ALL MY OWN A VERY SHORT VISIT TO MISSUS ALLEN IN WHICH HENRY TALKED AT RANDOM WITHOUT SENSE OR CONNECTION AND CATHERINE
19-227-0031 SCARCELY OPENED HER LIPS DISMISSED THEM TO THE ECSTASIES OF ANOTHER TETE A TETE AND BEFORE IT WAS SUFFERED TO CLOSE SHE WAS ENABLED TO JUDGE HOW FAR HE WAS SANCTIONED BY PARENTAL AUTHORITY IN HIS PRESENT APPLICATION
19-227-0032 ON HIS RETURN FROM WOODSTON TWO DAYS BEFORE HE HAD BEEN MET NEAR THE ABBEY BY HIS IMPATIENT FATHER HASTILY INFORMED IN ANGRY TERMS OF MISS MORLAND'S DEPARTURE AND ORDERED TO THINK OF HER NO MORE
19-227-0033 SUCH WAS THE PERMISSION UPON WHICH HE HAD NOW OFFERED HER HIS HAND THE AFFRIGHTED CATHERINE AMIDST ALL THE TERRORS OF EXPECTATION AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS ACCOUNT
19-227-0034 COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REJECTION BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
19-227-0035 NOTHING TO LAY TO HER CHARGE BUT HER BEING THE INVOLUNTARY UNCONSCIOUS OBJECT OF A DECEPTION WHICH HIS PRIDE COULD NOT PARDON AND WHICH A BETTER PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO OWN
19-227-0036 AND DESIGNED HER FOR HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ON DISCOVERING HIS ERROR TO TURN HER FROM THE HOUSE SEEMED THE BEST THOUGH TO HIS FEELINGS AN INADEQUATE PROOF OF HIS RESENTMENT TOWARDS HERSELF AND HIS CONTEMPT OF HER FAMILY
19-227-0037 JOHN THORPE HAD FIRST MISLED HIM THE GENERAL PERCEIVING HIS SON ONE NIGHT AT THE THEATRE TO BE PAYING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO MISS MORLAND
19-227-0038 HAD ACCIDENTALLY INQUIRED OF THORPE IF HE KNEW MORE OF HER THAN HER NAME THORPE MOST HAPPY TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A MAN OF GENERAL TILNEY'S IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN JOYFULLY AND PROUDLY COMMUNICATIVE
