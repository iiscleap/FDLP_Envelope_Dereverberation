2416-152139-0049 AND IT WAS SAFER MUCH MORE CIRCUMSPECT ON YOUR PART NOT TO ORDER THE FLAT SEARCHED AT ONCE BUT ONLY AS A LAST RESORT AS IT WERE AFTER YOU HAD LED THE POLICE TO TRAIL HIM ALL EVENING AND STILL REMAIN WITHOUT A CLEW
2416-152139-0050 AND BESIDES OF COURSE NOT UNTIL YOU HAD PLANTED THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS TO DAMN HIM AND WRECK HIS LIFE AND HOME YOU WERE EVEN GENEROUS IN THE AMOUNT YOU DEPRIVED YOURSELF OF OUT OF THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

2416-152139-0058 THE PEN SPLUTTERED ON THE PAPER A BEAD OF SWEAT SPURTING FROM THE MAN'S FOREHEAD DROPPED TO THE SHEET THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE ROOM A MINUTE PASSED ANOTHER
2416-152139-0059 CARLING'S PEN TRAVELLED HALTINGLY ACROSS THE PAPER THEN WITH A QUEER LOW CRY AS HE SIGNED HIS NAME HE DROPPED THE PEN FROM HIS FINGERS AND RISING UNSTEADILY FROM HIS CHAIR
2416-152139-0060 I GUESS IT'S ALL UP I GUESS I KNEW IT WOULD BE SOME DAY MOYNE HADN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT I STOLE THE MONEY MYSELF FROM THE BANK TO NIGHT I GUESS IT'S ALL UP
2416-152139-0061 THOMAS H CARLING FROM THE PAPER JIMMIE DALE'S EYES SHIFTED TO THE FIGURE BY THE COUCH AND THE PAPER FLUTTERED SUDDENLY FROM HIS FINGERS TO THE DESK CARLING WAS REELING CLUTCHING AT HIS THROAT
2416-152139-0062 A SMALL GLASS VIAL ROLLED UPON THE CARPET AND THEN EVEN AS JIMMIE DALE SPRANG FORWARD THE OTHER PITCHED HEAD LONG OVER THE COUCH AND IN A MOMENT IT WAS OVER PRESENTLY JIMMIE DALE PICKED UP THE VIAL
2416-152139-0063 AND DROPPED IT BACK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN THERE WAS NO LABEL ON IT BUT IT NEEDED NONE THE STRONG PENETRATING ODOR OF BITTER ALMONDS WAS TELLTALE EVIDENCE ENOUGH IT WAS PRUSSIC
2416-152139-0064 OR HYDROCYANIC ACID PROBABLY THE MOST DEADLY POISON AND THE SWIFTEST IN ITS ACTION THAT WAS KNOWN TO SCIENCE CARLING HAD PROVIDED AGAINST THAT SOME DAY IN HIS CONFESSION FOR A LITTLE SPACE
2416-152139-0065 MOTIONLESS JIMMIE DALE STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT THE SILENT OUTSTRETCHED FORM THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE DESK AND SLOWLY DELIBERATELY PICKED UP THE SIGNED CONFESSION AND THE STEAMSHIP TICKET HE HELD THEM AN INSTANT
2416-152139-0066 STARING AT THEM THEN METHODICALLY BEGAN TO TEAR THEM INTO LITTLE PIECES A STRANGE TIRED SMILE HOVERING ON HIS LIPS THE MAN WAS DEAD NOW THERE WOULD BE DISGRACE ENOUGH FOR SOME ONE TO BEAR A MOTHER PERHAPS

2416-152139-0070 STILL HOLDING IT BY THE TWEEZERS DROPPED IT ON HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND PRESSED THE SEAL DOWN ON THE FACE OF THE TOPMOST PACKAGE OF BANKNOTES HE TIED THE PARCEL UP THEN AND PICKING UP THE PEN ADDRESSED IT IN PRINTED CHARACTERS
2416-152139-0071 WITH THE PARCEL UNDER HIS ARM STEPPED TO THE DOOR AND UNLOCKED IT HE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT ON THE THRESHOLD FOR A SINGLE QUICK COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM THEN PASSED ON OUT INTO THE STREET
2416-152139-0072 AT THE CORNER HE STOPPED TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE AND THE FLAME OF THE MATCH SPURTING UP DISCLOSED A FACE THAT WAS WORN AND HAGGARD HE THREW THE MATCH AWAY SMILED A LITTLE WEARILY AND WENT ON

2436-2476-0018 THE THIRD PASSENGER HAD EVIDENTLY KEPT OUT OF THE ARGUMENT SNAP INTRODUCED HIM AS RANCE RANKIN AN AMERICAN A QUIET BLOND FELLOW OF THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY I ORDERED MY BREAKFAST AND LET THE ARGUMENT GO ON
2436-2476-0019 I DEAL IN TRICKS HOW TO FOOL AN AUDIENCE HIS KEEN AMUSED GAZE WAS ON OB HAHN THIS GENTLEMAN FROM VENUS AND I HAVE TOO MUCH IN COMMON TO ARGUE

2436-2476-0025 I ANSWERED HER GREETING AND MET GEORGE PRINCE'S CASUAL GAZE HE TOO SMILED AS THOUGH TO SIGNIFY THAT HIS SISTER HAD TOLD HIM OF THE SERVICE I HAD DONE HER OR WAS HIS SMILE AN IRONICAL MEMORY OF HOW HE HAD ELUDED ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CHASED HIM
2436-2476-0026 I GAZED AFTER HIS SMALL WHITE SUITED FIGURE AS HE FOLLOWED ANITA FROM THE SALON AND THINKING OF HER I PRAYED THAT CARTER AND HALSEY MIGHT BE WRONG WHATEVER PLOTTING AGAINST THE GRANTLINE EXPEDITION MIGHT BE GOING ON
