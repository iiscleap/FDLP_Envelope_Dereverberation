4813-248641-0007 EARTHEN FLOOR AND A STAGE BEHIND THE CHARMING STEEPLE STYLE MADE POPULAR BY SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN AND NOW MULTIPLIED IN COUNTLESS GRACEFUL EXAMPLES ALL OVER NEW ENGLAND
4813-248641-0008 THE OLD SHIP IS ENTIRELY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS AWAITING IT THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE OLDEST HOUSE FOR PUBLIC WORSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH STILL STANDS ON ITS ORIGINAL SITE AND WHICH IS STILL USED FOR ITS ORIGINAL PURPOSE
4813-248641-0009 IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY ONE IT IS MERELY THE NEW MEETING HOUSE OF THE LITTLE HAMLET OF HINGHAM THE PEOPLE ARE VERY PROUD OF THEIR NEW BUILDING THE TIMBERS HAVE BEEN HEWN WITH THE BROAD AXE OUT OF SOLID WHITE PINE
4813-248641-0010 THE MARKS ARE STILL VISIBLE PARTICULARLY IN THOSE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF OPEN TO THE ATTIC THE BELFRY IS PRECISELY IN THE CENTER OF THE FOUR SIDED PITCHED ROOF TO BE SURE THIS NECESSITATES RINGING THE BELL FROM ONE OF THE PEWS
4813-248641-0011 BUT A LITTLE LATER THE BELLRINGER WILL STAND ABOVE AND THROUGH A PANE OF GLASS LET INTO THE CEILING HE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHEN THE MINISTER ENTERS THE PULPIT THE ORIGINAL BACKLESS BENCHES WERE REPLACED BY BOX PEWS WITH NARROW SEATS LIKE SHELVES
4813-248641-0012 NO PAINT NO DECORATIONS NO COLORED WINDOWS NO ORGAN OR ANYTHING WHICH COULD EVEN REMOTELY SUGGEST THE COLOR THE BEAUTY THE FORMALISM OF THE CHURCHES OF ENGLAND
4813-248641-0013 SINCE IN SIXTEEN THIRTY FIVE THE GENERAL COURT DECREED THAT NO DWELLING
4813-248641-0014 OF ANY NEW PLANTATION THUS ELIMINATING THE EXCUSE OF TOO GREAT DISTANCE EVERY ONE IS EXPECTED NAY COMMANDED TO COME TO CHURCH IN FACT AFTER THE TOLLING OF THE LAST BELL THE HOUSES MAY ALL BE SEARCHED
4813-248641-0015 EACH TEN FAMILIES IS UNDER AN INSPECTOR IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION OF DELINQUENTS HIDING IN THEM AND SO IN TWOS AND THREES OFTEN THE MAN TRUDGING AHEAD WITH HIS GUN AND THE WOMAN CARRYING HER BABY WHILE THE SMALLER CHILDREN CLING TO HER SKIRTS
4813-248641-0016 SOMETIMES MAN AND WOMAN AND A CHILD OR TWO ON HORSEBACK NO MATTER HOW WILD THE STORM HOW SWOLLEN THE STREAMS HOW DEEP THE WHIRLING SNOW THEY ALL COME TO CHURCH
4813-248641-0017 THE CONGREGATION EITHER WAITS FOR THE MINISTER AND HIS WIFE OUTSIDE THE DOOR OR STANDS UNTIL HE HAS ENTERED THE PULPIT ONCE INSIDE THEY ARE SEATED WITH THE MOST METICULOUS EXACTNESS ACCORDING TO RANK AGE SEX AND WEALTH
4813-248641-0018 AND THE SLAVES AND INDIANS ARE IN THE REAR TO SEAT ONE'S SELF IN THE WRONG PUE IS AN OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE HERE IS THE CHURCH AND HERE ARE THE PEOPLE AS THE OLD RHYME HAS IT WHAT THEN OF THE SERVICES
4813-248641-0019 THAT THEY ARE INTERMINABLE WE KNOW THE TITHING MAN OR CLERK MAY TURN THE BRASS BOUND HOURGLASS BY THE SIDE OF THE PULPIT TWO AND THREE TIMES DURING THE SERMON AND ONCE OR TWICE DURING THE PRAYER INTERMINABLE
4813-248641-0020 THE OLD SHIP WAS NOT HEATED UNTIL EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO THE ONLY RELIEF FROM THE CHILL AND STIFFNESS COMES DURING THE PRAYER WHEN THE CONGREGATION STANDS KNEELING OF COURSE WOULD SAVOR TOO STRONGLY OF IDOLATRY AND THE CHURCH OF ROME
4813-248641-0021 THEY STAND TOO WHILE THE PSALMS AND HYMNS ARE LINED OUT AND AS THEY SING THEM VERY UNCERTAINLY AND VERY INCORRECTLY THIS PERFORMANCE ALONE SOMETIMES TAKES AN HOUR AS THERE IS NO ORGAN NOR NOTES
4813-248641-0022 AND ONLY A FEW COPIES OF THE BAY PSALM BOOK OF WHICH BY THE WAY A COPY NOW WOULD BE WORTH MANY TIMES ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD AFTER THE MORNING SERVICE THERE IS A NOON INTERMISSION IN WHICH THE HALF FROZEN CONGREGATION STIRS AROUND
4813-248641-0023 ONE SOMETIMES WONDERS HOW THE LITTLE THINGS HAD ANY IMPULSE TO LAUGH IN SUCH AN ABYSMAL ATMOSPHERE BUT APPARENTLY THE PURITAN BOYS AND GIRLS WERE ENTIRELY NORMAL AND EVEN WHOLESOMELY MISCHIEVOUS AS PROVED BY THE CONSTANTLY REQUIRED SERVICES OF THE TITHING MAN
4813-248641-0024 THESE EXTERNAL TRAPPINGS OF THE SERVICE SOUND DEPRESSING ENOUGH BUT IF THE MESSAGE RECEIVED WITHIN THESE CHILLY WALLS IS CHEERING MAYBE WE CAN FORGET OR IGNORE THE PHYSICAL DISCOMFORTS BUT IS THE MESSAGE CHEERING HELL DAMNATION ETERNAL TORTURES
4813-248641-0025 PAINFUL THEOLOGICAL HAIR SPLITTINGS HARROWING SELF EXAMINATIONS AND HUMILIATING PUBLIC CONFESSIONS THIS IS WHAT THEY GATHER ON THE NARROW WOODEN BENCHES TO LISTEN TO HOUR AFTER HOUR SEARCHING THEIR SOULS FOR SIN WITH AN ALMOST FRENZIED EAGERNESS
4813-248641-0026 APPEALING TO THE EMOTIONS QUITE AS VIVIDLY ALTHOUGH THROUGH A DIFFERENT CHANNEL AS THE MOST ELABORATE CEREMONIAL WHEN THE SOUL IS WROUGHT TO A CERTAIN PITCH EACH HARDSHIP IS MERELY AN ADDED OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE ITS FAITH
4813-248641-0027 FROM THE MOTHER CHURCH AND THE MOTHER COUNTRY AND FORTIFY THEM IN THEIR STRUGGLE IN A NEW LAND IT WAS RELIGIOUS ZEAL WHICH FURNISHED THIS MOTIVE POWER DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTS AND DIFFERENTLY DIRECTED FORCE ARE NEEDED TO EXTRACT THE DIAMOND FROM THE EARTH
4813-248641-0028 HAVING DONE ITS WORK HAVING FOUNDED SOUNDLY AND PEOPLED STRONGLY AN EXCEPTIONAL REGION THE NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE HAD NO FURTHER NECESSITY FOR BEING THOSE WHOM IT NOW TORTURES WITH ITS HOT PINCERS OF DOUBT AND SELF REPROACH
4813-248641-0029 ARE SACRIFICED TO A CAUSE LONG SINCE WON THE PURITANS THEMSELVES GREW AWAY FROM MANY OF THEIR EXCESSIVE SEVERITIES BUT AS THEY GAINED BODILY STRENGTH FROM THEIR CONFLICT WITH THE ELEMENTS SO THEY GAINED A CERTAIN MORAL STAMINA
4813-248641-0030 BY THEIR SELF IMPOSED RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE AND THIS MORAL STAMINA HAS MARKED NEW ENGLAND EVER SINCE AND MARKED HER TO HER GLORY ONE CANNOT SPEAK OF HINGHAM CHURCHES INDEED ONE CANNOT SPEAK OF HINGHAM
4813-248641-0031 WITHOUT ADMIRING MENTION OF THE NEW NORTH CHURCH THIS BUILDING OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS AND FINISH WITHIN AND WITHOUT BUILT BY BULFINCH IN EIGHTEEN O SIX IS ONE OF THE MOST FLAWLESS EXAMPLES OF ITS TYPE ON THE SOUTH SHORE
4813-248641-0032 YOU WILL APPRECIATE THE CREAM COLORED PAINT THE BUFF WALLS THE QUAINT BOX PEWS OF OILED WOOD WITH HANDRAILS GLEAMING FROM THE TOUCH OF MANY GENERATIONS WITH WOODEN BUTTONS AND PROTRUDING HINGES PROCLAIMING AN ANCIENT FASHION
4813-248641-0033 BUT THE UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE NEW NORTH CHURCH IS ITS SLAVE GALLERIES THESE TWO SMALL GALLERIES BETWEEN THE ROOF AND THE CHOIR LOFT HELD FOR THIRTY YEARS IN DIMINISHING NUMBERS NEGROES AND INDIANS
4813-248641-0034 THE LAST OCCUPANT WAS A BLACK LUCRETIA WHO AFTER BEING FREED WAS INVITED TO SIT DOWNSTAIRS WITH HER MASTER AND MISTRESS WHICH SHE DID AND WHICH SHE CONTINUED TO DO UNTIL HER DEATH NOT SO VERY LONG AGO
4813-248641-0035 HINGHAM ITS MAIN STREET ALAS FOR THE ORIGINAL NAME OF BACHELORS ROWE ARCHED BY A DOUBLE ROW OF SUPERB ELMS ON EITHER SIDE IS INCALCULABLY RICH IN OLD HOUSES OLD TRADITIONS OLD FAMILIES
4813-248641-0036 EVEN MOTORING THROUGH TOO QUICKLY AS MOTORISTS MUST ONE CANNOT HELP BEING STRUCK BY THE SUBSTANTIAL DIGNITY OF THE PLACE BY THE WELL KEPT PROSPERITY OF THE HOUSES LARGE AND SMALL WHICH FRINGE THE FINE OLD HIGHWAY
4813-248641-0037 THE TOWN HAS PRESERVED A CRANFORD LIKE CHARM AND WHY NOT WHEN THE VERY HOUSE IS STILL HANDSOMELY PRESERVED WHERE THE NAMELESS NOBLEMAN FRANCIS LE BARON WAS CONCEALED BETWEEN THE FLOORS
4813-248641-0038 AND AS WE ARE TOLD IN MISSUS AUSTEN'S NOVEL VERY PROPERLY CAPPED THE CLIMAX BY MARRYING HIS BRAVE LITTLE PROTECTOR MOLLY WILDER WHY NOT WHEN THE LINCOLN FAMILY ANCESTORS OF ABRAHAM
4813-248641-0039 NAMED AFTER THE INDIAN CHIEF WHO GRANTED THE ORIGINAL DEEDS OF THE TOWN HAS FOUND QUARTERS IN AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING HOUSE DATING FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY IN THE SPACIOUS LIVING ROOM ARE SEVENTEEN PANELS ON THE WALLS AND IN THE DOORS
4813-248641-0040 PAINTED WITH CHARMING OLD FASHIONED SKILL BY JOHN HAZLITT THE BROTHER OF THE ENGLISH ESSAYIST THE REVEREND DANIEL SHUTE HOUSE BUILT IN SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX IS PRACTICALLY INTACT WITH ITS PANELED ROOMS
4813-248641-0041 AND WALL PAPER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD HINGHAM'S FAMOUS ELMS SHADE THE HOUSE WHERE PARSON EBENEZER GAY LIVED OUT HIS LONG PASTORATE OF SIXTY NINE YEARS AND NINE MONTHS AND THE GARRISON HOUSE BUILT BEFORE SIXTEEN FORTY
4813-248641-0042 SHELTERED IN ITS PRIME NINE GENERATIONS OF THE SAME FAMILY THE RAINBOW ROOF HOUSE SO CALLED FROM THE DELICIOUS CURVE IN ITS ROOF IS ONE OF HINGHAM'S PRETTIEST TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD COTTAGES AND MISS SUSAN B WILLARD'S COTTAGE
4813-248641-0043 IS ONE OF THE OLDEST IN THE UNITED STATES DERBY ACADEMY FOUNDED ALMOST TWO CENTURIES AND A HALF AGO BY MADAM DERBY STILL MAINTAINS ITS SOCIAL AND SCHOLARLY PRESTIGE THROUGH ALL THE EDUCATIONAL TURMOIL OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
4813-248641-0044 THAT JOHN ALBION ANDREW WHO PROVED HIMSELF SO TRULY ONE OF OUR GREAT MEN DURING THE CIVIL WAR COURTED ELIZA JONES HERSEY AND HERE THAT THE HAPPY YEARS OF THEIR EARLY MARRIED LIFE WERE SPENT
4813-248641-0045 LATER ANOTHER GOVERNOR JOHN D LONG WAS FOR MANY YEARS A MIGHTY FIGURE IN THE TOWN WITH ITS ANCIENT CHURCHES AND INSTITUTIONS ITS PENSIVE GRAVEYARDS AND LOVELY ELMS
4813-248641-0046 HINGHAM TYPIFIES WHAT IS QUAINTEST AND BEST IN NEW ENGLAND TOWNS POSSIBLY THE DAPPLING OF THE ELMS POSSIBLY THE SHADOW OF THE OLD SHIP CHURCH
4813-248641-0047 HOWEVER IT MAY SEEM TO ITS INHABITANTS TO THE STRANGER EVERYTHING IN HINGHAM IS TINCTURED BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE STERN OLD ECCLESIASTICISM EVEN THE NUMBER OF HISTORIC FORTS SEEMS A PROPER PART OF THOSE RIGHTEOUS DAYS
4813-248641-0048 FOR WHEN DID RELIGION AND WARFARE NOT GO HAND IN HAND DURING THE TROUBLE WITH KING PHILIP THE TOWN HAD THREE FORTS ONE AT FORT HILL ONE AT THE CEMETERY AND ONE ON THE PLAIN ABOUT A MILE FROM THE HARBOR AND THE SITES MAY STILL BE IDENTIFIED
4813-248641-0049 WERE LANDED ON THEIR SALTY DECKS FOR FIFTY YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN AND EIGHTEEN SIXTY THE RAPID SAILED AS A PACKET BETWEEN THIS TOWN AND BOSTON MAKING THE TRIP ON ONE MEMORABLE OCCASION IN SIXTY SEVEN MINUTES
4813-248641-0050 SHE WAS CARRIED UP THE WEYMOUTH RIVER AND COVERED MASTS AND HULL WITH GREEN BUSHES SO THAT THE MARAUDING BRITISH CRUISERS MIGHT NOT FIND HER AND AS WE READ WE FIND OURSELVES REMEMBERING THAT CAMOUFLAGE IS NEW ONLY IN NAME
4813-248641-0051 OR WOULD THEY REALIZE THAT THEIR SOWING HAD BROUGHT FORTH RICHER FRUIT THAN THEY COULD GUESS IT HAS ALL CHANGED SINCE PURITAN DAYS AND YET PERHAPS IN NO OTHER PLACE IN NEW ENGLAND DOES THE HAND OF THE PAST LIE SO VISIBLY UPON THE COMMUNITY
4813-248641-0052 YOU CANNOT LIFT YOUR EYES BUT THEY REST UPON SOME BUILDING RAISED TWO CENTURIES AND MORE AGO THE SHADE WHICH RIPPLES UNDER YOUR FEET IS CAST BY ELMS PLANTED BY THAT VERY HAND OF THE PAST EVEN YOUR VOICE REPEATS THE WORDS WHICH THOSE OLD PATRIARCHS
4813-248641-0053 WELL VERSED IN BIBLICAL LORE CHOSE FOR THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD NAMES ACCORD POND AND GLAD TIDINGS PLAIN MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIFTED FROM SOME PILGRIM'S PROGRESS WHILE THE NEAR BY SEA OF GALILEE AND JERUSALEM ROAD
4813-248641-0054 ARE FROM THE GOOD BOOK ITSELF WHICH WAY TO EGYPT IS THIS AN ECHO FROM THAT TIME WHEN THE BIBLE WAS THE CORNER STONE OF CHURCH AND STATE OF HOME AND SCHOOL WHAT'S THE BEST ROAD TO JERICHO BEACH SURELY IT IS SOME GRAVE FACED SHADE WHO CALLS
4830-25898-0000 THERE NEVER WAS A PROUDER MAMMA THAN MADAM CLUCK WHEN SHE LED FORTH HER FAMILY OF EIGHT DOWNY LITTLE CHICKS CHANTICLEER STRUT SNOWBALL SPECKLE PEEP PECK DOWNY AND BLOT WERE THEIR NAMES
4830-25898-0001 AND NO SOONER WERE THEY OUT OF THE SHELL THAN THEY BEGAN TO CHIRP AND SCRATCH AS GAILY AS IF THE BIG WORLD IN WHICH THEY SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES WAS MADE FOR THEIR ESPECIAL BENEFIT IT WAS A FINE BROOD
4830-25898-0002 BUT POOR MADAM CLUCK HAD BAD LUCK WITH HER CHICKS FOR THEY WERE HER FIRST AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THEM OLD AUNT COCKLETOP TOLD HER THAT SHE DIDN'T AND PREDICTED THAT THOSE POOR DEARS WOULD COME TO BAD ENDS
4830-25898-0003 AUNT COCKLETOP WAS RIGHT AS YOU WILL SEE WHEN I HAVE TOLD THE SAD HISTORY OF THIS UNFORTUNATE FAMILY THE TRAGEDY BEGAN WITH CHANTY WHO WAS THE BOLDEST LITTLE COCKADOODLE WHO EVER TRIED TO CROW
4830-25898-0004 BEFORE HE HAD A FEATHER TO HIS BIT OF A TAIL CHANTY BEGAN TO FIGHT AND SOON WAS KNOWN AS THE MOST QUARRELSOME CHICK IN THE FARM YARD HAVING PECKED HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS HE TRIED TO DO THE SAME TO HIS PLAYMATES
4830-25898-0005 THE DUCKLINGS GOSLINGS AND YOUNG TURKEYS AND WAS SO DISAGREEABLE THAT ALL THE FOWLS HATED HIM ONE DAY A PAIR OF BANTAMS ARRIVED PRETTY LITTLE WHITE BIRDS WITH RED CRESTS AND NICE YELLOW FEET
4830-25898-0006 CHANTY THOUGHT HE COULD BEAT MISTER BANTAM EASILY HE WAS SO SMALL AND INVITED HIM TO FIGHT MISTER B DECLINED THEN CHANTY CALLED HIM A COWARD AND GAVE MISSUS B A PECK
4830-25898-0007 WHICH ENDED IN CHANTY'S UTTER DEFEAT FOR HE DIED FROM HIS WOUNDS DOWNY AND SNOWBALL SOON FOLLOWED FOR THE TWO SWEET LITTLE THINGS WOULD SWING ON THE BURDOCK LEAVES THAT GREW OVER THE BROOK
4830-25898-0008 SITTING SIDE BY SIDE THE PLUMP SISTERS WERE PLACIDLY SWAYING UP AND DOWN OVER THE CLEAR BROWN WATER RIPPLING BELOW WHEN AH SAD TO RELATE THE STEM BROKE AND DOWN WENT LEAF
4830-25898-0009 CHICKENS AND ALL TO A WATERY DEATH I'M THE MOST UNLUCKY HEN EVER HATCHED GROANED
4830-25898-0010 AND IT DID SEEM SO FOR THE VERY NEXT WEEK SPECKLE THE BEST AND PRETTIEST OF THE BROOD WENT TO WALK WITH AUNT COCKLETOP GRASSHOPPERING THEY CALLED IT IN THE GREAT FIELD ACROSS THE ROAD
4830-25898-0011 WHAT A NICE TIME SPECKLE DID HAVE TO BE SURE FOR THE GRASSHOPPERS WERE LIVELY AND FAT AND AUNT WAS IN AN UNUSUALLY AMIABLE MOOD NEVER RUN AWAY FROM ANYTHING BUT FACE DANGER AND CONQUER IT
4830-25898-0012 LIKE A BRAVE CHICK SAID THE OLD BIDDY AS SHE WENT CLUCKING THROUGH THE GRASS WITH HER GRAY TURBAN WAGGING IN THE WIND SPECKLE HAD HOPPED AWAY FROM A TOAD WITH A STARTLED CHIRP WHICH CAUSED AUNT TO UTTER THAT REMARK
4830-25898-0013 THE WORDS HAD HARDLY LEFT HER BEAK WHEN A SHADOW ABOVE MADE HER LOOK UP GIVE ONE LOUD CROAK OF ALARM AND THEN SCUTTLE AWAY AS FAST AS LEGS AND WINGS COULD CARRY HER LITTLE SPECKLE REMEMBERING THE ADVICE
4830-25898-0014 AND UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DANGER STOOD HER GROUND AS A GREAT HAWK CAME CIRCLING NEARER AND NEARER TILL WITH A SUDDEN DART HE POUNCED ON THE POOR CHICKEN AND BORE IT AWAY CHIRPING DISMALLY
4830-25898-0015 WHAT SHALL I DO IT WAS A DREADFUL BLOW TO MISSUS CLUCK AND AUNT COCKLETOP DIDN'T SHOW HERSELF FOR A WHOLE DAY AFTER THAT STORY WAS KNOWN
4830-25898-0016 FOR EVERY FOWL IN THE YARD TWITTED HER WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER PREACHING AND HER PRACTICE
4830-25898-0017 HE WAS AT IT FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND EVERYONE WAS TIRED TO DEATH OF HEARING HIS SHRILL SMALL VOICE MAKING FUNNY ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE HOARSE LITTLE CROWS AS HE SAT ON THE WALL AND STRETCHED HIS YELLOW NECK
4830-25898-0018 TILL HIS THROAT QUITE ACHED WITH THE EFFORT AH IF I COULD ONLY FLY TO THE HIGHEST BEAM IN THE BARN AND GIVE A SPLENDID CROW THAT EVERYONE COULD HEAR I SHOULD BE PERFECTLY HAPPY SAID THIS SILLY LITTLE FOWL
4830-25898-0019 SO HE TRIED EVERY DAY TO FLY AND CROW AND AT LAST MANAGED TO GET UP THEN HOW HE DID STRUT AND RUSTLE HIS FEATHERS WHILE HIS PLAYMATES SAT BELOW AND WATCHED HIM
4830-25898-0020 YOU'LL FALL AND GET HURT SAID HIS SISTER BLOT HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU UGLY LITTLE THING AND DON'T TALK TO ME I'M GOING TO CROW AND CAN'T BE INTERRUPTED BY ANY SILLY BIT OF A HEN BE QUIET DOWN THERE
4830-25898-0021 AND HEAR IF I CAN'T DO IT AS WELL AS DADDY THE CHICKS STOPPED SCRATCHING AND PEEPING AND SAT IN A ROW TO HEAR STRUT CROW PERCHING HIMSELF ON THE BEAM HE TRIED HIS BEST
4830-25898-0022 CAME OF IT AND ALL THE CHICKS LAUGHED THAT MADE STRUT MAD AND HE RESOLVED TO CROW EVEN IF HE KILLED HIMSELF DOING IT HE GAVE AN ANGRY CLUCK FLAPPED HIS WINGS AND TRIED AGAIN ALAS ALAS
4830-25898-0023 FOR POOR STRUT HE LEANED SO FAR FORWARD IN HIS FRANTIC EFFORT TO GET A BIG CROW OUT THAT HE TOPPLED OVER AND FELL BUMP ON THE HARD BARN FLOOR KILLING HIMSELF INSTANTLY
4830-25898-0024 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THIS MISSUS CLUCK KEPT HER THREE REMAINING LITTLE ONES CLOSE TO HER SIDE WATCHING OVER THEM WITH MATERNAL CARE TILL THEY WERE HEARTILY TIRED OF HER ANXIOUS CLUCKINGS PEEP AND PECK WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER
4830-25898-0025 BEING VERY FOND OF ONE ANOTHER PEEP WAS A MOST INQUISITIVE CHICKEN POKING HER HEAD INTO EVERY NOOK AND CORNER AND NEVER SATISFIED TILL SHE HAD SEEN ALL THERE WAS TO SEE PECK WAS A GLUTTON
4830-25898-0026 EATING EVERYTHING SHE COULD FIND AND OFTEN MAKING HERSELF ILL BY GOBBLING TOO FAST AND FORGETTING TO EAT A LITTLE GRAVEL TO HELP DIGEST HER FOOD DON'T GO OUT OF THE BARN CHILDREN I'M GOING TO LAY AN EGG

4830-25898-0030 SAM NEVER SAW HER BUT SHUT DOWN THE COVER OF THE BIN AS HE PASSED AND LEFT POOR PEEP TO DIE NO ONE KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER TILL SOME DAYS LATER WHEN SHE WAS FOUND DEAD IN THE MEAL
4830-25898-0031 WITH HER POOR LITTLE CLAWS STICKING STRAIGHT UP AS IF IMPLORING HELP PECK MEANWHILE GOT INTO MISCHIEF ALSO
4830-25898-0032 SHE STRAYED INTO THE SHEEP SHED AND FINDING SOME SALT ATE AS MUCH AS SHE LIKED NOT KNOWING THAT SALT IS BAD FOR HENS HAVING TAKEN ALL SHE WANTED SHE RAN BACK TO THE BARN
4830-25898-0033 AND WAS INNOCENTLY CATCHING GNATS WHEN HER MAMMA CAME OUT OF THE HAY MOW WITH A LOUD CUT CUT CUT
