426-122822-0013 EVERYBODY REALIZED THAT EVEN THE EXPLOSION HAD NOT CLEARED THE TEACHER'S MENTAL ATMOSPHERE NOBODY EXCEPT ANTHONY PYE DARED WHISPER A WORD NED CLAY ACCIDENTALLY SQUEAKED HIS PENCIL WHILE WORKING A SUM CAUGHT ANNE'S EYE AND WISHED THE FLOOR WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW HIM UP
426-122822-0014 CHESTER SLOANE SPELLING ODORIFEROUS WITH TWO F'S WAS MADE TO FEEL THAT HE COULD NEVER LIVE DOWN THE DISGRACE OF IT EITHER IN THIS WORLD OR THAT WHICH IS TO COME
426-122822-0015 BUT THE KNOWLEDGE ONLY ANGERED HER FURTHER
426-122822-0016 HE PEERED ACROSS HIS BOOK AT ANNE HIS BLACK EYES SPARKLING WITH CURIOSITY AND MOCKERY ANNE TWITCHED OPEN THE DRAWER OF HER DESK IN SEARCH OF CHALK AND UNDER HER VERY HAND A LIVELY MOUSE SPRANG OUT OF THE DRAWER SCAMPERED OVER THE DESK AND LEAPED TO THE FLOOR
426-122822-0017 ESPECIALLY AS SHE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHERE THE MOUSE HAD GONE BUT SHE DECIDED NOT TO WHO COULD TAKE ANY COMFORT OUT OF HYSTERICS WITH A TEACHER SO WHITE FACED AND SO BLAZING EYED STANDING BEFORE ONE WHO PUT THAT MOUSE IN MY DESK SAID ANNE
426-122822-0018 HER VOICE WAS QUITE LOW BUT IT MADE A SHIVER GO UP AND DOWN PAUL IRVING'S SPINE JOE SLOANE CAUGHT HER EYE FELT RESPONSIBLE FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLE OF HIS FEET BUT STUTTERED OUT WILDLY
426-122822-0019 ANNE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE WRETCHED JOSEPH SHE LOOKED AT ANTHONY PYE AND ANTHONY PYE LOOKED BACK UNABASHED AND UNASHAMED ANTHONY WAS IT YOU YES IT WAS SAID ANTHONY INSOLENTLY
426-122822-0020 ANNE TOOK HER POINTER FROM HER DESK IT WAS A LONG HEAVY HARDWOOD POINTER COME HERE ANTHONY IT WAS FAR FROM BEING THE MOST SEVERE PUNISHMENT ANTHONY PYE HAD EVER UNDERGONE ANNE
426-122822-0021 EVEN THE STORMY SOULED ANNE SHE WAS AT THAT MOMENT COULD NOT HAVE PUNISHED ANY CHILD CRUELLY BUT THE POINTER NIPPED KEENLY AND FINALLY ANTHONY'S BRAVADO FAILED HIM HE WINCED AND THE TEARS CAME TO HIS EYES ANNE CONSCIENCE STRICKEN DROPPED THE POINTER AND TOLD ANTHONY TO GO TO HIS SEAT
426-122822-0022 SHE SAT DOWN AT HER DESK FEELING ASHAMED REPENTANT AND BITTERLY MORTIFIED HER QUICK ANGER WAS GONE AND SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEEK RELIEF IN TEARS SO ALL HER BOASTS HAD COME TO THIS SHE HAD ACTUALLY WHIPPED ONE OF HER PUPILS
426-122822-0023 KEPT BACK HER TEARS UNTIL SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT THEN SHE SHUT HERSELF IN THE EAST GABLE ROOM AND WEPT ALL HER SHAME AND REMORSE AND DISAPPOINTMENT INTO HER PILLOWS WEPT SO LONG THAT MARILLA GREW ALARMED INVADED THE ROOM AND INSISTED ON KNOWING WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
426-122822-0024 THE TROUBLE IS I'VE GOT THINGS THE MATTER WITH MY CONSCIENCE SOBBED ANNE OH THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A JONAH DAY MARILLA I'M SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF I LOST MY TEMPER AND WHIPPED ANTHONY PYE I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID MARILLA WITH DECISION
426-122822-0025 IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO OH NO NO MARILLA AND I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN EVER LOOK THOSE CHILDREN IN THE FACE AGAIN I FEEL THAT I HAVE HUMILIATED MYSELF TO THE VERY DUST YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CROSS AND HATEFUL AND HORRID I WAS
426-122822-0026 OH MARILLA I HAVE TRIED SO HARD TO BE PATIENT AND TO WIN ANTHONY'S LIKING AND NOW IT HAS ALL GONE FOR NOTHING MARILLA PASSED HER HARD WORK WORN HAND OVER THE GIRL'S GLOSSY TUMBLED HAIR WITH A WONDERFUL TENDERNESS
426-122822-0027 WHEN ANNE'S SOBS GREW QUIETER SHE SAID VERY GENTLY FOR HER YOU TAKE THINGS TOO MUCH TO HEART ANNE WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES BUT PEOPLE FORGET THEM AND JONAH DAYS COME TO EVERYBODY AS FOR ANTHONY PYE WHY NEED YOU CARE IF HE DOES DISLIKE YOU
426-122822-0028 HE IS THE ONLY ONE I CAN'T HELP IT I WANT EVERYBODY TO LOVE ME AND IT HURTS ME SO WHEN ANYBODY DOESN'T AND ANTHONY NEVER WILL NOW OH I JUST MADE AN IDIOT OF MYSELF TODAY MARILLA I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
426-122822-0029 JUST COME DOWNSTAIRS AND HAVE YOUR SUPPER YOU'LL SEE IF A GOOD CUP OF TEA AND THOSE PLUM PUFFS I MADE TODAY WON'T HEARTEN YOU UP PLUM PUFFS WON'T MINISTER TO A MIND DISEASED SAID ANNE DISCONSOLATELY
426-122822-0030 IT HAD SNOWED SOFTLY AND THICKLY ALL THROUGH THE HOURS OF DARKNESS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WHITENESS GLITTERING IN THE FROSTY SUNSHINE LOOKED LIKE A MANTLE OF CHARITY CAST OVER ALL THE MISTAKES AND HUMILIATIONS OF THE PAST EVERY MORN IS A FRESH BEGINNING
426-122822-0031 EVERY MORN IS THE WORLD MADE NEW SANG ANNE AS SHE DRESSED OWING TO THE SNOW SHE HAD TO GO AROUND BY THE ROAD TO SCHOOL AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPISH COINCIDENCE THAT ANTHONY PYE SHOULD COME PLOUGHING ALONG JUST AS SHE LEFT THE GREEN GABLES LANE
426-122822-0032 ANNE SURRENDERED HER BOOKS AND WONDERED IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY BE AWAKE ANTHONY WALKED ON IN SILENCE TO THE SCHOOL BUT WHEN ANNE TOOK HER BOOKS SHE SMILED DOWN AT HIM NOT THE STEREOTYPED KIND SMILE SHE HAD SO PERSISTENTLY ASSUMED FOR HIS BENEFIT
426-122822-0033 BUT A SUDDEN OUTFLASHING OF GOOD COMRADESHIP ANTHONY SMILED NO IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD ANTHONY GRINNED BACK A GRIN IS NOT GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A RESPECTFUL THING
426-122822-0034 MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE CAME UP THE NEXT SATURDAY AND CONFIRMED THIS WELL ANNE I GUESS YOU'VE WON OVER ANTHONY PYE THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS HE BELIEVES YOU ARE SOME GOOD AFTER ALL EVEN IF YOU ARE A GIRL SAYS THAT WHIPPING YOU GAVE HIM WAS JUST AS GOOD AS A MAN'S
426-122822-0035 NO BUT THE PYES ARE AN EXCEPTION TO EVERY KNOWN RULE THAT'S WHAT DECLARED MISSUS RACHEL WITH CONVICTION
4297-13006-0000 NEITHER AT DINNER ON THAT EVENING AT MANCHESTER SQUARE NOR AFTER DINNER AS LONG AS MISSUS ROBY REMAINED IN THE HOUSE WAS A WORD SAID ABOUT LOPEZ BY MISTER WHARTON HE REMAINED LONGER THAN USUAL WITH HIS BOTTLE OF PORT WINE IN THE DINING ROOM
4297-13006-0001 BUT AS SOON AS MISSUS ROBY WAS GONE AND MISSUS ROBY WENT HOME ROUND THE CORNER SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN USUAL THEN MISTER WHARTON WOKE UP INSTANTLY AND MADE INQUIRY OF HIS DAUGHTER
4297-13006-0002 THERE HAD HOWEVER BEEN A FEW WORDS SPOKEN ON THE SUBJECT BETWEEN MISSUS ROBY AND HER NIECE WHICH HAD SERVED TO PREPARE EMILY FOR WHAT WAS COMING LOPEZ HAS BEEN TO YOUR FATHER
4297-13006-0003 IF HE DID NOT MEAN YOU TO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF WHY DIDN'T HE KEEP A CLOSER LOOK OUT I HAVEN'T CHOSEN ANY ONE AUNT HARRIET WELL TO SPEAK FAIRLY I THOUGHT YOU HAD AND I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST YOUR CHOICE
4297-13006-0004 NO DOUBT YOUR PAPA WILL HAVE IT OUT WITH YOU JUST NOW SO YOU HAD BETTER MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHAT YOU WILL SAY TO HIM IF YOU REALLY LIKE THE MAN I DON'T SEE WHY YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SO AND STICK TO IT HE HAS MADE A REGULAR OFFER AND GIRLS IN THESE DAYS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE THEIR FATHER'S SLAVES
4297-13006-0005 MISSUS ROBY WAS PLEASED WITH LITTLE INTRIGUES WAS ADDICTED TO THE AMUSEMENT OF FOSTERING LOVE AFFAIRS WAS FOND OF BEING THOUGHT TO BE USEFUL IN SUCH MATTERS AND WAS NOT AVERSE TO HAVING PRESENTS GIVEN TO HER SHE HAD MARRIED A VULGAR MAN
4297-13006-0006 AND THOUGH SHE HAD NOT BECOME LIKE THE MAN SHE HAD BECOME VULGAR SHE WAS NOT AN ELIGIBLE COMPANION FOR MISTER WHARTON'S DAUGHTER A MATTER AS TO WHICH THE FATHER HAD NOT GIVEN HIMSELF PROPER OPPORTUNITIES OF LEARNING THE FACTS AN AUNT IN HIS CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS SO GREAT A COMFORT TO HIM
4297-13006-0007 SO READY AND SO NATURAL AN ASSISTANCE TO HIM IN HIS DIFFICULTIES BUT EMILY WHARTON WAS NOT IN THE LEAST LIKE HER AUNT NOR HAD MISSUS WHARTON BEEN AT ALL LIKE MISSUS ROBY NO DOUBT THE CONTACT WAS DANGEROUS
4297-13006-0008 INJURY HAD PERHAPS ALREADY BEEN DONE IT MAY BE THAT SOME SLIGHTEST SOIL HAD ALREADY MARRED THE PURE WHITE OF THE GIRL'S NATURAL CHARACTER BUT IF SO THE STAIN WAS AS YET TOO IMPALPABLE TO BE VISIBLE TO ORDINARY EYES
4297-13006-0009 RATHER EXCEEDING THE AVERAGE PROPORTIONS AS WELL AS HEIGHT OF WOMEN HER FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND HANDSOME AND HER FORM WAS PERFECT BUT IT WAS BY HER MANNER AND HER VOICE THAT SHE CONQUERED RATHER THAN BY HER BEAUTY
4297-13006-0010 WHICH STRANGERS DID NOT FIND ON HER FACE BUT AS WE DO NOT LIGHT UP OUR HOUSES WITH OUR BRIGHTEST LAMPS FOR ALL COMERS SO NEITHER DID SHE EMIT FROM HER EYES THEIR BRIGHTEST SPARKS TILL SPECIAL OCCASION FOR SUCH SHINING HAD ARISEN
4297-13006-0011 TO THOSE WHO WERE ALLOWED TO LOVE HER NO WOMAN WAS MORE LOVABLE THERE WAS INNATE IN HER AN APPRECIATION OF HER OWN POSITION AS A WOMAN AND WITH IT A PRINCIPLE OF SELF DENIAL AS A HUMAN BEING WHICH IT WAS BEYOND THE POWER OF ANY MISSUS ROBY TO DESTROY
4297-13006-0012 THE YOUNG MAN MAY BECOME LORD CHANCELLOR OR AT ANY RATE EARN HIS BREAD COMFORTABLY AS A COUNTY COURT JUDGE BUT THE GIRL CAN LOOK FORWARD TO LITTLE ELSE THAN THE CHANCE OF HAVING A GOOD MAN FOR HER HUSBAND A GOOD MAN
4297-13006-0013 OR IF HER TASTES LIE IN THAT DIRECTION A RICH MAN EMILY WHARTON HAD DOUBTLESS THOUGHT ABOUT THESE THINGS AND SHE SINCERELY BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE GOOD MAN IN FERDINAND LOPEZ
4297-13006-0014 WHEN GOING TO MISTER WHARTON AT HIS CHAMBERS HE HAD NOT INTENDED TO CHEAT THE LAWYER INTO ANY ERRONEOUS IDEA ABOUT HIS FAMILY
4297-13006-0015 AND MISTER WHARTON HAD FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO ABSTAIN FROM ALLUSION TO SUCH MATTERS FROM AN ASSURED FEELING THAT HE COULD NOT IN THAT DIRECTION PLANT AN ENDURING OBJECTION IN THIS WAY LOPEZ HAD CARRIED HIS POINT WITH MISTER WHARTON
4297-13006-0016 AND THIS HE HAD DONE WITHOUT EVER HAVING ASKED FOR HER LOVE AND HE HAD EVEN TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO ALLURE DICK AND HAD LISTENED TO AND HAD TALKED WHOLE PAGES OUT OF BELL'S LIFE ON HIS OWN BEHALF IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED
4297-13006-0017 THAT HE DID LOVE THE GIRL AS WELL PERHAPS AS HE WAS CAPABLE OF LOVING ANY ONE BUT HE HAD FOUND OUT MANY PARTICULARS AS TO MISTER WHARTON'S MONEY BEFORE HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AS SOON AS MISSUS ROBY HAD GATHERED UP HER KNITTING
4297-13006-0018 AND DECLARED AS SHE ALWAYS DID ON SUCH OCCASIONS THAT SHE COULD GO ROUND THE CORNER WITHOUT HAVING ANY ONE TO LOOK AFTER HER
4297-13006-0019 HE CAME TO ME TO DAY AND ASKED FOR MY PERMISSION TO ADDRESS YOU SHE SAT PERFECTLY QUIET STILL LOOKING AT HIM BUT SHE DID NOT SAY A WORD OF COURSE I DID NOT GIVE HIM PERMISSION WHY OF COURSE PAPA
4297-13006-0020 BECAUSE HE IS A STRANGER AND A FOREIGNER WOULD YOU HAVE WISHED ME TO TELL HIM THAT HE MIGHT COME YES PAPA HE WAS SITTING ON A SOFA AND SHRANK BACK A LITTLE FROM HER AS SHE MADE THIS FREE AVOWAL
4297-13006-0021 IN THAT CASE I COULD HAVE JUDGED FOR MYSELF I SUPPOSE EVERY GIRL WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT BUT SHOULD YOU HAVE ACCEPTED HIM I THINK I SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED YOU BEFORE I DID THAT BUT I SHOULD HAVE WISHED TO ACCEPT HIM PAPA I DO LOVE HIM
4297-13006-0022 I HAVE NEVER SAID SO BEFORE TO ANY ONE I WOULD NOT SAY SO TO YOU NOW IF HE HAD NOT SPOKEN TO YOU AS HE HAS DONE EMILY IT MUST NOT BE WHY NOT PAPA IF YOU SAY IT SHALL NOT BE SO IT SHALL NOT
4297-13006-0023 I WILL DO AS YOU BID ME THEN HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AND CARESSED HER STROKING DOWN HER HAIR BUT I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME WHY IT MUST NOT BE
4297-13006-0024 HE IS A FOREIGNER BUT IS HE AND WHY SHOULD NOT A FOREIGNER BE AS GOOD AS AN ENGLISHMAN HIS NAME IS FOREIGN BUT HE TALKS ENGLISH AND LIVES AS AN ENGLISHMAN HE HAS NO RELATIVES NO FAMILY NO BELONGINGS
4297-13006-0025 HE IS WHAT WE CALL AN ADVENTURER MARRIAGE MY DEAR IS A MOST SERIOUS THING YES PAPA I KNOW THAT ONE IS BOUND TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW CAN I GIVE YOU TO A MAN I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT AN ADVENTURER
4297-13006-0026 WHAT WOULD THEY SAY IN HEREFORDSHIRE I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY SHOULD SAY ANYTHING BUT IF THEY DID I SHOULDN'T MUCH CARE I SHOULD MY DEAR I SHOULD CARE VERY MUCH ONE IS BOUND TO THINK OF ONE'S FAMILY SUPPOSE IT SHOULD TURN OUT AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS
4297-13006-0027 DISREPUTABLE YOU MAY SAY THAT OF ANY MAN PAPA BUT WHEN A MAN HAS CONNEXIONS A FATHER AND MOTHER OR UNCLES AND AUNTS PEOPLE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THEN THERE IS SOME GUARANTEE OF SECURITY
4297-13006-0028 DID YOU EVER HEAR THIS MAN SPEAK OF HIS FATHER I DON'T KNOW THAT I EVER DID OR HIS MOTHER OR HIS FAMILY DON'T YOU THINK THAT IS SUSPICIOUS
4297-13006-0029 I WOULD NOT WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH ASKING IF THERE HAS BEEN INTIMACY BETWEEN YOU SUCH INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE COME NATURALLY AS A THING OF COURSE YOU HAVE MADE HIM NO PROMISE OH NO PAPA
4297-13006-0030 NOR SPOKEN TO HIM OF YOUR REGARD FOR HIM NEVER NOT A WORD NOR HE TO ME EXCEPT IN SUCH WORDS AS ONE UNDERSTANDS EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOTHING I WISH HE HAD NEVER SEEN YOU IS HE A BAD MAN PAPA
4297-13006-0031 PAPA I WISH YOU KNEW HIM BETTER THAN YOU DO I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW HIM BETTER IS NOT THAT PREJUDICE PAPA MY DEAR EMILY SAID MISTER WHARTON STRIVING TO WAX INTO ANGER
4297-13006-0032 THAT HE MIGHT BE FIRM AGAINST HER I DON'T THINK THAT IT BECOMES YOU TO ASK YOUR FATHER SUCH A QUESTION AS THAT YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE CHIEF OBJECT OF MY LIFE TO DO THE BEST I CAN FOR MY CHILDREN I AM SURE IT IS
4297-13006-0033 AND YOU OUGHT TO FEEL THAT AS I HAVE HAD A LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD MY JUDGMENT ABOUT A YOUNG MAN MIGHT BE TRUSTED THAT WAS A STATEMENT WHICH MISS WHARTON WAS NOT PREPARED TO ADMIT
4297-13006-0034 SHE HAD ALREADY PROFESSED HERSELF WILLING TO SUBMIT TO HER FATHER'S JUDGMENT AND DID NOT NOW BY ANY MEANS CONTEMPLATE REBELLION AGAINST PARENTAL AUTHORITY BUT SHE DID FEEL THAT ON A MATTER SO VITAL TO HER
4297-13006-0035 SHE HAD A RIGHT TO PLEAD HER CAUSE BEFORE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN AND SHE WAS NOT SLOW TO ASSURE HERSELF EVEN AS THIS INTERVIEW WENT ON THAT HER LOVE FOR THE MAN WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO ENTITLE HER TO ASSURE HER FATHER THAT HER HAPPINESS DEPENDED ON HIS REVERSAL OF THE SENTENCE
4297-13006-0036 ALREADY PRONOUNCED YOU KNOW PAPA THAT I TRUST YOU SHE SAID AND I HAVE PROMISED YOU THAT I WILL NOT DISOBEY YOU
4297-13006-0037 YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL YOU WERE ALWAYS A GOOD GIRL BUT I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO HEAR ME THEN HE STOOD STILL WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS TROWSERS POCKETS LOOKING AT HER
4297-13006-0038 HE DID NOT WANT TO HEAR A WORD BUT HE FELT THAT HE WOULD BE A TYRANT IF HE REFUSED IF YOU TELL ME THAT I AM NOT TO SEE HIM I SHALL NOT SEE HIM BUT I SHALL BE VERY UNHAPPY I DO LOVE HIM AND I SHALL NEVER LOVE ANY ONE ELSE IN THE SAME WAY
4297-13006-0039 IF IT IS ONLY BECAUSE MISTER LOPEZ HAS A FOREIGN NAME IT ISN'T ONLY THAT NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT HIM OR WHERE TO INQUIRE EVEN I THINK YOU SHOULD INQUIRE PAPA AND BE QUITE CERTAIN BEFORE YOU PRONOUNCE SUCH A SENTENCE AGAINST ME
4297-13006-0040 IT WILL BE A CRUSHING BLOW HE LOOKED AT HER AND SAW THAT THERE WAS A FIXED PURPOSE IN HER COUNTENANCE OF WHICH HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SIMILAR SIGNS YOU CLAIM A RIGHT TO MY OBEDIENCE AND I ACKNOWLEDGE IT
4297-13006-0041 I AM SURE YOU BELIEVE ME WHEN I PROMISE NOT TO SEE HIM WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION I DO BELIEVE YOU OF COURSE I BELIEVE YOU BUT IF I DO THAT FOR YOU PAPA I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY SURE ON MY ACCOUNT
4297-13006-0042 I WILL OF COURSE I WILL AND HE BEGAN THE PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HER BUT WHAT WAS THERE TO THINK ABOUT NOTHING THAT SHE HAD SAID ALTERED IN THE LEAST HIS IDEA ABOUT THE MAN
4297-13006-0043 HE WAS AS CONVINCED AS EVER THAT UNLESS THERE WAS MUCH TO CONCEAL THERE WOULD NOT BE SO MUCH CONCEALMENT BUT A FEELING BEGAN TO GROW UPON HIM ALREADY THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD A MODE OF PLEADING WITH HIM WHICH HE WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO RESIST
4297-13006-0044 HE HAD THE POWER HE KNEW OF PUTTING AN END TO THE THING ALTOGETHER HE HAD ONLY TO SAY RESOLUTELY AND UNCHANGEABLY THAT THE THING SHOULDN'T BE AND IT WOULDN'T BE
4297-13009-0000 THEY WERE HABITUALLY INDIFFERENT TO SELF EXALTATION AND ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE THRUST INTO THIS OR THAT UNFITTING ROLE PROFESSING THAT THE QUEEN'S GOVERNMENT AND THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY WERE THEIR ONLY CONSIDERATIONS
4297-13009-0001 BECAUSE IT WAS FELT ON ALL SIDES THAT SIR ORLANDO COULD NOT JOIN THE NEW COMPOSITE PARTY WITHOUT HIGH PLACE AND THE SAME GRACE WAS SHOWN IN REGARD TO LORD DRUMMOND WHO REMAINED AT THE COLONIES KEEPING THE OFFICE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN LATELY TRANSFERRED UNDER MISTER DAUBENY
4297-13009-0002 FOR LEGAL OFFICES HAVE A SIGNIFICATION DIFFERING MUCH FROM THAT WHICH ATTACHES ITSELF TO PLACES SIMPLY POLITICAL A LORD CHANCELLOR BECOMES A PEER AND ON GOING OUT OF OFFICE ENJOYS A LARGE PENSION WHEN THE WOOLSACK HAS BEEN REACHED THERE COMES AN END OF DOUBT
4297-13009-0003 AND A BEGINNING OF EASE SIR GREGORY WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN AND THIS WAS A TERRIBLE BLOW BUT HE BORE IT MANFULLY SAYING NOT A WORD WHEN THE DUKE SPOKE TO HIM BUT HE BECAME CONVINCED FROM THAT MOMENT THAT NO MORE INEFFICIENT LAWYER EVER SAT UPON THE ENGLISH BENCH
4297-13009-0004 OR A MORE PRESUMPTUOUS POLITICIAN IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT THAN LORD RAMSDEN THE REAL STRUGGLE HOWEVER LAY IN THE APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RATTLERS AND THE ROBYS THE FITZGIBBONS AND THE MACPHERSONS AMONG THE SUBORDINATE OFFICES OF STATE
4297-13009-0005 MISTER MACPHERSON AND MISTER ROBY WITH A HOST OF OTHERS WHO HAD BELONGED TO MISTER DAUBENY WERE PREPARED AS THEY DECLARED FROM THE FIRST TO LEND THEIR ASSISTANCE TO THE DUKE THEY HAD CONSULTED MISTER DAUBENY ON THE SUBJECT AND MISTER DAUBENY TOLD THEM THAT THEIR DUTY LAY IN THAT DIRECTION
4297-13009-0006 AT THE FIRST BLUSH OF THE MATTER THE ARRANGEMENT TOOK THE FORM OF A GRACIOUS TENDER FROM THEMSELVES TO A STATESMAN CALLED UPON TO ACT IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY WERE THANKED ACCORDINGLY BY THE DUKE WITH SOMETHING OF REAL CORDIAL GRATITUDE
4297-13009-0007 HE WAS ASTOUNDED NOT SO MUCH BY THE PRETENSIONS AS BY THE UNBLUSHING ASSERTION OF THESE PRETENSIONS IN REFERENCE TO PLACES WHICH HE HAD BEEN INNOCENT ENOUGH TO THINK WERE ALWAYS BESTOWED AT ANY RATE WITHOUT DIRECT APPLICATION HE HAD MEASURED HIMSELF RIGHTLY WHEN HE TOLD THE OLDER DUKE
4297-13009-0008 IN ONE OF THOSE ANXIOUS CONVERSATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BEFORE THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE THAT LONG AS HE HAD BEEN IN OFFICE HIMSELF HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS THE WAY OF BESTOWING OFFICE TWO GENTLEMEN HAVE BEEN HERE THIS MORNING HE SAID ONE DAY TO THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY
4297-13009-0009 ONE ON THE HEELS OF THE OTHER EACH ASSURING ME NOT ONLY THAT THE WHOLE STABILITY OF THE ENTERPRISE DEPENDS ON MY GIVING A CERTAIN OFFICE TO HIM BUT ACTUALLY TELLING ME TO MY FACE THAT I HAD PROMISED IT TO HIM THE OLD STATESMAN LAUGHED
4297-13009-0010 TO BE TOLD WITHIN THE SAME HALF HOUR BY TWO MEN THAT I HAD MADE PROMISES TO EACH OF THEM INCONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER WHO WERE THE TWO MEN MISTER RATTLER AND MISTER ROBY I AM ASSURED THAT THEY ARE INSEPARABLE SINCE THE WORK WAS BEGUN
4297-13009-0011 THEY ALWAYS HAD A LEANING TO EACH OTHER AND NOW I HEAR THEY PASS THEIR TIME BETWEEN THE STEPS OF THE CARLTON AND REFORM CLUBS BUT WHAT AM I TO DO ONE MUST BE PATRONAGE SECRETARY NO DOUBT THEY'RE BOTH GOOD MEN IN THEIR WAY YOU KNOW
4297-13009-0012 BUT WHY DO THEY COME TO ME WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN LIKE DOGS CRAVING A BONE IT USED NOT TO BE SO OF COURSE MEN WERE ALWAYS ANXIOUS FOR OFFICE AS THEY ARE NOW WELL YES WE'VE HEARD OF THAT BEFORE TO DAY I THINK
4297-13009-0013 BUT I DON'T THINK ANY MAN EVER VENTURED TO ASK MISTER MILDMAY TIME HAD DONE MUCH FOR HIM IN CONSOLIDATING HIS AUTHORITY AND PERHAPS THE PRESENT WORLD IS LESS RETICENT IN ITS EAGERNESS THAN IT WAS IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS I DOUBT HOWEVER
4297-13009-0014 WHETHER IT IS MORE DISHONEST AND WHETHER STRUGGLES WERE NOT MADE QUITE AS DISGRACEFUL TO THE STRUGGLERS AS ANYTHING THAT IS DONE NOW YOU CAN'T ALTER THE MEN AND YOU MUST USE THEM THE YOUNGER DUKE SAT DOWN AND SIGHED OVER THE DEGENERATE PATRIOTISM OF THE AGE
4297-13009-0015 BUT AT LAST EVEN THE RATTLERS AND ROBYS WERE FIXED IF NOT SATISFIED AND A COMPLETE LIST OF THE MINISTRY APPEARED IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS THOUGH THE THING HAD BEEN LONG A DOING STILL IT HAD COME SUDDENLY
4297-13009-0016 SO THAT AT THE FIRST PROPOSITION TO FORM A COALITION MINISTRY THE NEWSPAPERS HAD HARDLY KNOWN WHETHER TO ASSIST OR TO OPPOSE THE SCHEME THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF ALL THESE EDITORS AND CONTRIBUTORS THE TEACHING OF A TRADITION THAT COALITIONS OF THIS KIND HAVE BEEN GENERALLY FEEBLE
4297-13009-0017 SOMETIMES DISASTROUS AND ON OCCASIONS EVEN DISGRACEFUL WHEN A MAN PERHAPS THROUGH A LONG POLITICAL LIFE HAS BOUND HIMSELF TO A CERTAIN CODE OF OPINIONS HOW CAN HE CHANGE THAT CODE AT A MOMENT
4297-13009-0018 AND WHEN AT THE SAME MOMENT TOGETHER WITH THE CHANGE HE SECURES POWER PATRONAGE AND PAY HOW SHALL THE PUBLIC VOICE ABSOLVE HIM BUT THEN AGAIN MEN WHO HAVE BY THE WORK OF THEIR LIVES GROWN INTO A CERTAIN POSITION IN THE COUNTRY
4297-13009-0019 AND HAVE UNCONSCIOUSLY BUT NOT THEREFORE LESS ACTUALLY MADE THEMSELVES INDISPENSABLE EITHER TO THIS SIDE IN POLITICS OR TO THAT CANNOT FREE THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGING THEM WHEN A PERIOD COMES SUCH AS THAT NOW REACHED
4297-13009-0020 THIS ALSO THE NEWSPAPERS PERCEIVED AND HAVING SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SESSION BEEN VERY LOUD IN EXPOSING THE DISGRACEFUL COLLAPSE OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COULD HARDLY REFUSE THEIR SUPPORT TO ANY ATTEMPT AT A FEASIBLE ARRANGEMENT
4297-13009-0021 WHEN IT WAS FIRST KNOWN THAT THE DUKE OF OMNIUM HAD CONSENTED TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT THEY HAD BOTH ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER BEEN LOUD IN HIS PRAISE GOING SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MAN IN ENGLAND WHO COULD DO THE WORK
4297-13009-0022 BUT WHEN THE NEWSPAPERS TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MAN FOR THE OCCASION HOW COULD HE BE JUSTIFIED IN CREDITING HIMSELF IN PREFERENCE TO THEM THE WORK IN PARLIAMENT BEGAN UNDER THE NEW AUSPICES WITH GREAT TRANQUILLITY
4297-13009-0023 AND FURTHER EDUCATION QUESTIONS ALL MEN KNEW WHO KNEW ANYTHING BUT FOR THE MOMENT FOR THE MONTH EVEN PERHAPS FOR THE SESSION THERE WAS TO BE PEACE WITH FULL LATITUDE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ROUTINE DUTIES THERE WAS SO TO SAY NO OPPOSITION
4297-13009-0024 AND AT FIRST IT SEEMED THAT ONE SPECIAL BENCH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WOULD REMAIN UNOCCUPIED BUT AFTER A DAY OR TWO ON ONE OF WHICH MISTER DAUBENY HAD BEEN SEEN SITTING JUST BELOW THE GANGWAY THAT GENTLEMAN RETURNED TO THE PLACE USUALLY HELD BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S RIVAL
4297-13009-0025 SAYING WITH A SMILE THAT IT MIGHT BE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE HOUSE THAT THE SEAT SHOULD BE UTILISED MISTER GRESHAM AT THIS TIME HAD WITH DECLARED PURPOSE ASKED AND OBTAINED THE SPEAKER'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND WAS ABROAD WHO SHOULD LEAD THE HOUSE
4297-13009-0026 THAT HAD BEEN A GREAT QUESTION CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND WHAT OFFICE SHOULD THE LEADER HOLD MISTER MONK HAD CONSENTED TO TAKE THE EXCHEQUER
4297-13009-0027 WAS AT LAST ASSIGNED TO SIR ORLANDO DROUGHT IT WILL NEVER DO SAID MISTER RATTLER TO MISTER ROBY I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST DROUGHT WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY USEFUL MAN TO YOUR PARTY BUT HE LACKS SOMETHING OF THE POSITION
4297-13009-0028 THE FACT IS SAID ROBY THAT WE'VE TRUSTED TO TWO MEN SO LONG THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO SUPPOSE ANY ONE ELSE BIG ENOUGH TO FILL THEIR PLACES MONK WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THE HOUSE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MONK I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE WILSON
4297-13009-0029 AND SO I TOLD THE DUKE HE HAD AN IDEA THAT IT SHOULD BE ONE OF YOUR MEN I THINK HE'S RIGHT THERE SAID ROBY THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING LIKE A FAIR DIVISION INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE CONTENT BUT THE PARTY WOULD BE DISSATISFIED
4297-13009-0030 FOR MYSELF I'D HAVE SOONER STAYED OUT AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER BUT DAUBENY SAID THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS BOUND TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL I TOLD THE DUKE FROM THE BEGINNING SAID RATTLER THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT I COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HIM
4297-13009-0031 OF COURSE I WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT I HAD BEEN TOO THOROUGHLY A PARTY MAN FOR A NEW MOVEMENT OF THIS KIND BUT HE SAID JUST THE SAME THAT HE CONSIDERED I WAS BOUND TO JOIN HIM I ASKED GRESHAM AND WHEN GRESHAM SAID SO TOO OF COURSE I HAD NO HELP FOR IT
