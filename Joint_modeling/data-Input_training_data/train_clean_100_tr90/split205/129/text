5022-29405-0024 LEAVING THE HOUSE I TOOK THE WAY ONCE MORE THAT LED TO FORDWITCH WOOD WHAT WOULD MISSUS ROYLAKE HAVE SAID IF SHE HAD DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GOING BACK TO THE MILL THERE WAS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE THE PORTFOLIO WAS A TRUST CONFIDED TO ME
5022-29405-0025 THE SOONER I RETURNED IT TO THE WRITER OF THE CONFESSION THE SOONER I TOLD HIM PLAINLY THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH I HAD ARRIVED THE MORE AT EASE MY MIND WOULD BE THE SLUGGISH RIVER LOOKED MUDDIER THAN EVER THE NEW COTTAGE LOOKED UGLIER THAN EVER
5022-29405-0026 I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR ON THE ANCIENT SIDE OF THE BUILDING
5022-29405-0027 HE STARED AT ME IN MOMENTARY PERPLEXITY AND SUDDENLY RECOVERING HIMSELF ASKED ME TO WALK IN ARE YOU THE YOUNG MASTER SIR AH YES YES I THOUGHT SO MY GIRL CRISTY SAID SHE SAW THE YOUNG MASTER LAST NIGHT THANK YOU KINDLY SIR I'M PRETTY WELL
5022-29405-0028 MY MEALS DON'T SHOW ON ME YOU WILL EXCUSE MY RECEIVING YOU IN THE KITCHEN SIR IT'S THE BEST ROOM WE HAVE DID CRISTY TELL YOU HOW BADLY WE ARE OFF HERE FOR REPAIRS YOU BEING OUR LANDLORD WE LOOK TO YOU TO HELP US WE ARE FALLING TO PIECES AS IT WERE
5022-29405-0029 ON THIS OLD SIDE OF THE HOUSE THERE'S FIRST DRAINS HE PROCEEDED TO RECKON UP THE REPAIRS COUNTING WITH HIS FLESHLESS THUMB ON HIS SKINNY FINGERS WHEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A CURIOUS SUCCESSION OF SOUNDS WHICH BEGAN WITH WHINING AND ENDED WITH SCRATCHING AT THE COTTAGE DOOR
5022-29405-0030 IN A MINUTE AFTER THE DOOR WAS OPENED FROM WITHOUT A BROWN DOG OF THE COMPANIONABLE RETRIEVER BREED RAN IN AND FAWNED UPON OLD TOLLER CRISTEL FOLLOWED FROM THE KITCHEN GARDEN WITH A BASKET OF VEGETABLES ON HER ARM
5022-29405-0031 I NOW SAW IN THEIR FULL BEAUTY THE LUSTER OF HER BROWN EYES THE WARM ROSINESS OF HER DARK COMPLEXION THE DELIGHTFUL VIVACITY OF EXPRESSION WHICH WAS THE CROWNING CHARM OF HER FACE SHE PAUSED CONFUSEDLY IN THE DOORWAY
5022-29405-0032 AND TRIED TO RESIST ME WHEN I INSISTED ON RELIEVING HER OF THE BASKET MISTER GERARD SHE PROTESTED
5022-29405-0033 MY ANSWER WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE ASSUMED THE FORM OF A FOOLISH COMPLIMENT IF HER FATHER HAD NOT SPARED HER THAT INFLICTION
5022-29405-0034 HE SAYS ALL RIGHT AND HE DOES NOTHING THERE'S FIRST AS I TOLD YOU JUST NOW THE TRULY DREADFUL STATE OF THE DRAINS I TRIED TO STOP HIM BY PROMISING TO SPEAK TO THE BAILIFF MYSELF ON HEARING THIS GOOD NEWS MISTER TOLLER'S GRATITUDE BECAME UNGOVERNABLE
5022-29405-0035 HE WAS MORE EAGER THAN EVER AND MORE ELOQUENT THAN EVER IN RETURNING TO THE REPAIRS AND THEN SIR THERE'S THE OVEN THEY DO CALL BREAD THE STAFF OF LIFE IT'S A BURNT STAFF AT ONE TIME AND A CLAMMY STAFF AT ANOTHER
5022-29405-0036 HIS DAUGHTER INTERFERED AND STOPPED HIM AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY OFFERING HIS ARM TO CONDUCT ME IN STATE ACROSS THE KITCHEN CRISTEL HAD JUST PUT HER PRETTY BROWN HAND OVER HIS MOUTH AND SAID OH FATHER DO PRAY BE QUIET
5022-29405-0037 WHEN WE WERE ALL THREE DISTURBED BY ANOTHER INTERRUPTION A SECOND DOOR COMMUNICATING AS I CONCLUDED FROM ITS POSITION WITH THE NEW COTTAGE WAS SUDDENLY OPENED IN THE INSTANT BEFORE THE PERSON BEHIND IT APPEARED THE DOG LOOKED THAT WAY
5022-29405-0038 STARTED UP FRIGHTENED AND TOOK REFUGE UNDER THE TABLE AT THE NEXT MOMENT THE DEAF LODGER WALKED INTO THE ROOM IT WAS HE BEYOND ALL DOUBT WHO HAD FRIGHTENED THE DOG FOREWARNED BY INSTINCT OF HIS APPEARANCE
5022-29405-0039 WHAT I HAD READ OF HIS WRITING DISPOSED ME NOW THAT I SAW THE MAN BY DAYLIGHT TO FIND SOMETHING DEVILISH IN THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE NO STRONG AS IT WAS MY PREJUDICE FAILED TO MAKE ANY DISCOVERIES THAT PRESENTED HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE
5022-29405-0040 HIS PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS TRIUMPHED IN THE CLEAR SEARCHING LIGHT I NOW PERCEIVED THAT HIS EYES WERE OF THAT DEEPLY DARK BLUE WHICH IS COMMONLY AND FALSELY DESCRIBED AS RESEMBLING THE COLOR OF THE VIOLET TO MY THINKING THEY WERE SO ENTIRELY BEAUTIFUL
5022-29405-0041 THAT THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO BE IN A MAN'S FACE
5022-29405-0042 TO THE SOFT PROFUSION OF HIS REDDISH BROWN HAIR TO HIS FINELY SHAPED SENSITIVE LIPS BUT FOR TWO MARKED PECULIARITIES IN HIM WHICH WOULD HAVE SHOWN ME TO BE WRONG THAT IS TO SAY THE EXPRESSION OF POWER ABOUT HIS HEAD
5022-29405-0043 AND THE SIGNS OF MASCULINE RESOLUTION PRESENTED BY HIS MOUTH AND CHIN ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST PERSON AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION WAS CRISTEL HE BOWED SMILED POSSESSED HIMSELF ABRUPTLY OF HER HAND AND KISSED IT
5022-29411-0000 MY LOYALTY TOWARDS THE AFFLICTED MAN WHOSE FRIENDLY ADVANCES I HAD SEEN GOOD REASON TO RETURN WAS IN NO SENSE SHAKEN HIS UNDESERVED MISFORTUNES HIS MANLY APPEAL TO ME AT THE SPRING
5022-29411-0001 STILL WHILE CRISTEL'S ENTREATIES AND CRISTEL'S INFLUENCE HAD FAILED TO SHAKE ME GLOODY'S STRANGE LANGUAGE AND GLOODY'S INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT HAD TROUBLED MY MIND I FELT VAGUELY UNEASY IRRITATED BY MY OWN DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS
5022-29411-0002 IF I HAD BEEN A PHILOSOPHER I SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE SYMPTOMS OF A VERY COMMON ATTACK OF A VERY WIDELY SPREAD MORAL MALADY THE MEANEST OF ALL HUMAN INFIRMITIES IS ALSO THE MOST UNIVERSAL AND THE NAME OF IT IS SELF ESTEEM
5022-29411-0003 IT IS PERHAPS ONLY RIGHT TO ADD THAT MY PATIENCE HAD BEEN TRIED BY THE PROGRESS OF DOMESTIC EVENTS WHICH AFFECTED LADY LENA AND MYSELF VIEWED AS VICTIMS CALLING WITH MY STEPMOTHER AT LORD UPPERCLIFF'S HOUSE LATER IN THE DAY
5022-29411-0004 OR MADE AN OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING TOGETHER CONFIDENTIALLY IN A CORNER AND ONCE OR TWICE I CAUGHT THEM LOOKING AT LADY LENA AND AT ME EVEN LORD UPPERCLIFF PERHAPS NOT YET TAKEN INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE
5022-29411-0005 NOTICED THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWO LADIES AND SEEMED TO BE AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND THEM WHEN MISSUS ROYLAKE AND I WERE TOGETHER AGAIN ON OUR WAY HOME I WAS PREPARED TO HEAR THE PRAISE OF LADY LENA FOLLOWED BY A DELICATE EXAMINATION INTO THE STATE OF MY HEART
5022-29411-0006 NEITHER OF THESE ANTICIPATIONS WAS REALIZED ONCE MORE MY CLEVER STEPMOTHER HAD PUZZLED ME MISSUS ROYLAKE TALKED AS FLUENTLY AS EVER EXHAUSTING ONE COMMON PLACE SUBJECT AFTER ANOTHER
5022-29411-0007 WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST ALLUSION TO MY LORD'S DAUGHTER TO MY MATRIMONIAL PROSPECTS OR TO MY VISITS AT THE MILL I WAS SECRETLY ANNOYED FEELING THAT MY STEPMOTHER'S SINGULAR INDIFFERENCE TO DOMESTIC INTERESTS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE
5022-29411-0008 RETURNING TO THE HOUSE I TRIED TO OCCUPY MYSELF WITH MY COLLECTION OF INSECTS SADLY NEGLECTED OF LATE USELESS MY OWN MOTHS FAILED TO INTEREST ME I WENT BACK TO THE GARDEN PASSING THE OPEN WINDOW OF ONE OF THE LOWER ROOMS WHICH LOOKED OUT ON THE TERRACE
5022-29411-0009 I SAW MISSUS ROYLAKE READING A BOOK IN SAD COLORED BINDING SHE WAS YAWNING OVER IT FEARFULLY WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT I WAS LOOKING AT HER EQUAL TO ANY EMERGENCY THIS REMARKABLE WOMAN INSTANTLY HANDED TO ME A SECOND AND SIMILAR VOLUME
5022-29411-0010 I LOOKED AT THE BOOK I OPENED THE BOOK I RECOVERED MY PRESENCE OF MIND AND HANDED IT BACK IF A FEMALE HUMBUG WAS ON ONE SIDE OF THE WINDOW A MALE HUMBUG WAS ON THE OTHER
5022-29411-0011 WHICH WAY DID I TURN MY STEPS MEN WILL WONDER WHAT POSSESSED ME WOMEN WILL THINK IT A PROCEEDING THAT DID ME CREDIT I TOOK THE FAMILIAR ROAD WHICH LED TO THE GLOOMY WOOD AND THE GUILTY RIVER THE LONGING IN ME TO SEE CRISTEL AGAIN WAS MORE THAN I COULD RESIST
5022-29411-0012 NOT BECAUSE I WAS IN LOVE WITH HER ONLY BECAUSE I HAD LEFT HER IN DISTRESS BEYOND THE SPRING AND WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE RIVER I SAW A LADY ADVANCING TOWARDS ME ON THE PATH WHICH LED FROM THE MILL BRISK SMILING TRIPPING ALONG LIKE A YOUNG GIRL
5022-29411-0013 BEHOLD THE MOCK REPUBLICAN KNOWN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AS LADY RACHEL SHE HELD OUT BOTH HANDS TO ME BUT FOR HER PETTICOATS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT I HAD MET WITH A JOLLY YOUNG MAN
5022-29411-0014 PATRONIZING PIETY ON THE WAY TO AFTERNOON CHURCH I MUST POSITIVELY MAKE A SKETCH OF THE COTTAGE BY THE MILL I MEAN OF COURSE THE PICTURESQUE SIDE OF IT THAT FINE GIRL OF TOLLER'S WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR SHE IS REALLY HANDSOMER THAN EVER ARE YOU GOING TO SEE HER YOU WICKED MAN
5022-29411-0015 WHEN WE HAD LEFT EACH OTHER I THOUGHT OF THE ABSENT CAPTAIN IN THE NAVY WHO WAS LADY RACHEL'S HUSBAND HE WAS A PERFECT STRANGER BUT I PUT MYSELF IN HIS PLACE AND FELT THAT I TOO SHOULD HAVE GONE TO SEA
5022-29411-0016 OLD TOLLER WAS ALONE IN HIS KITCHEN EVIDENTLY ANNOYED AND ANGRY WE ARE ALL AT SIXES AND SEVENS MISTER GERARD I'VE HAD ANOTHER ROW WITH THAT DEAF DEVIL MY NEW NAME FOR HIM AND I THINK IT'S RATHER CLEVER
5022-29411-0017 HE SWEARS SIR THAT HE WON'T GO AT THE END OF HIS WEEK'S NOTICE
5022-29411-0018 AND SHOOT THE MAN AND SHOOT HIMSELF AHA
5022-29411-0019 I'LL BE EVEN WITH HIM YOU MARK MY WORDS I'LL BE EVEN WITH HIM THAT OLD TOLLER THE MOST EXASPERATING OF MEN JUDGED BY A QUICK TEMPER HAD IRRITATED MY FRIEND INTO SPEAKING RASHLY WAS PLAIN ENOUGH NEVERTHELESS I FELT SOME ANXIETY
5022-29411-0020 ABOUT CRISTEL AFTER LOOKING ROUND THE KITCHEN AGAIN I ASKED WHERE SHE WAS SITTING FORLORN IN HER BEDROOM CRYING HER FATHER TOLD ME I WENT OUT FOR A WALK BY THE RIVER AND I SAT DOWN AND BEING SUNDAY I FELL ASLEEP WHEN I WOKE AND GOT HOME AGAIN JUST NOW THAT
5022-29411-0021 WAS HOW I FOUND HER I DON'T LIKE TO HEAR MY GIRL CRYING SHE'S AS GOOD AS GOLD AND BETTER NO SIR OUR DEAF DEVIL IS NOT TO BLAME FOR THIS HE HAS GIVEN CRISTY NO REASON TO COMPLAIN OF HIM SHE SAYS SO HERSELF AND SHE NEVER TOLD A LIE YET
5022-29411-0022 BUT MISTER TOLLER I OBJECTED SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO DISTRESS HER HAS SHE NOT TOLD YOU WHAT IT IS NOT SHE OBSTINATE ABOUT IT LEAVES ME TO GUESS IT'S CLEAR TO MY MIND MISTER GERARD THAT SOMEBODY HAS GOT AT HER IN MY ABSENCE
5022-29411-0023 YOU WILL ASK ME WHO THE PERSON IS
5022-29411-0024 BUT YOU MEAN TO TRY YES I MEAN TO TRY HE ANSWERED ME WITH LITTLE OF THE ENERGY WHICH GENERALLY DISTINGUISHED HIM PERHAPS HE WAS FATIGUED OR PERHAPS HE HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK OF I OFFERED A SUGGESTION WHEN WE ARE
5022-29411-0025 IN WANT OF HELP I SAID WE SOMETIMES FIND IT NEARER THAN WE HAD VENTURED TO EXPECT AT OUR OWN DOORS THE ANCIENT MILLER ROSE AT THAT HINT LIKE A FISH AT A FLY GLOODY HE CRIED FIND HIM AT ONCE MISTER TOLLER
5022-29411-0026 I'VE GOT BURDENS ON MY MIND HE EXPLAINED OR I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT TOO HAVING DONE JUSTICE TO HIS OWN ABILITIES HE BUSTLED OUT IN LESS THAN A MINUTE HE WAS BACK AGAIN IN A STATE OF BREATHLESS TRIUMPH GLOODY HAS SEEN THE PERSON HE ANNOUNCED AND
5022-29411-0027 I BECKONED TO GLOODY WAITING MODESTLY AT THE DOOR TO COME IN AND TELL ME WHAT HE HAD DISCOVERED I SAW HER OUTSIDE SIR RAPPING AT THE DOOR HERE WITH HER PARASOL THAT WAS THE SERVANT'S REPORT HER PARASOL
5022-29411-0028 MISS CRISTEL LOOKED LIKE A PERSON SURPRISED AT SEEING A STRANGER WHAT I SHOULD CALL A FREE AND EASY STRANGER SHE WALKED IN SIR AS IF THE PLACE BELONGED TO HER I AM NOT SUSPICIOUS BY NATURE AS I HOPE AND BELIEVE
5022-29411-0029 THE HAT I HAD SEEN ON THE HEAD OF THAT HATEFUL WOMAN WAS NOW SUFFICIENTLY DESCRIBED FOR A MAN SLY OLD TOLLER LEAVING GLOODY UNNOTICED AND KEEPING HIS EYE ON ME SAW THE SIGNS OF CONVICTION IN MY FACE AND SAID WITH HIS CUSTOMARY AUDACITY
5022-29411-0030 WHO IS SHE I FOLLOWED AT MY HUMBLE DISTANCE THE EXAMPLE OF SIR WALTER SCOTT WHEN INQUISITIVE PEOPLE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS IN PLAIN ENGLISH I DENIED ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRANGER WEARING THE GREEN HAT
5022-29411-0031 BUT I WAS NATURALLY DESIROUS OF DISCOVERING NEXT WHAT LADY RACHEL HAD SAID AND I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH CRISTEL HER FAR SEEING FATHER MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE PERCEIVED A CHANCE OF LISTENING TO OUR CONVERSATION
5022-29411-0032 HE LED ME TO THE DOOR OF HIS DAUGHTER'S ROOM AND STOOD CLOSE BY WHEN I KNOCKED SOFTLY AND BEGGED THAT SHE WOULD COME OUT THE TONE OF THE POOR GIRL'S VOICE ANSWERING FORGIVE ME SIR I CAN'T DO IT CONVICTED THE SHE SOCIALIST AS I THOUGHT
5022-29411-0033 OF MERCILESS CONDUCT OF SOME SORT ASSUMING THIS CONCLUSION TO BE THE RIGHT ONE I DETERMINED THEN AND THERE THAT LADY RACHEL SHOULD NOT PASS THE DOORS OF TRIMLEY DEEN AGAIN IF HER BOSOM FRIEND RESENTED THAT WISE ACT OF SEVERITY BY LEAVING THE HOUSE I SHOULD SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION
5022-29411-0034 AND SHOULD REMEMBER THE CIRCUMSTANCE WITH PLEASURE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE ILL CRISTEL WAS ALL I COULD FIND TO SAY UNDER THE DOUBLE DISADVANTAGE OF SPEAKING THROUGH A DOOR AND HAVING A FATHER LISTENING AT MY SIDE OH NO MISTER GERARD NOT ILL
5022-29411-0035 PRAY BE KINDER TO ME THAN EVER PRAY LET ME BE I SAID I WOULD RETURN ON THE NEXT DAY AND LEFT THE ROOM WITH A SORE HEART OLD TOLLER HIGHLY APPROVED OF MY CONDUCT HE RUBBED HIS FLESHLESS HANDS AND WHISPERED
5022-29411-0036 YOU'LL GET IT OUT OF CRISTY TO MORROW AND I'LL HELP YOU I FOUND GLOODY WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE HE WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT MISS CRISTEL HIS ONLY EXCUSE HE TOLD ME BEING THE FEAR THAT SHE MIGHT BE ILL HAVING SET HIM AT EASE IN THAT PARTICULAR I SAID
5022-29411-0037 YOU SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN MISS CRISTEL HIS ANSWER RAISED HIM A STEP HIGHER IN MY ESTIMATION HOW CAN I HELP IT SIR AN ODD MAN WITH A PERSONAL APPEARANCE THAT MIGHT EXCITE A PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM IN SOME MINDS
5022-29411-0038 I FAILED TO SEE IT MYSELF IN THAT LIGHT IT STRUCK ME AS I WALKED HOME THAT CRISTEL MIGHT HAVE MADE MANY A WORSE FRIEND THAN THE RETIRED PRIZE FIGHTER A CHANGE IN MY MANNER WAS OF COURSE REMARKED BY MISSUS ROYLAKE'S READY OBSERVATION
5022-29411-0039 I TOLD HER THAT I HAD BEEN ANNOYED AND OFFERED NO OTHER EXPLANATION WONDERFUL TO RELATE SHE SHOWED NO CURIOSITY AND NO SURPRISE MORE WONDERFUL STILL AT EVERY FAIR OPPORTUNITY THAT OFFERED SHE KEPT OUT OF MY WAY
5022-29411-0040 MY NEXT DAY'S ENGAGEMENT BEING FOR SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING I PUT MISSUS ROYLAKE'S SELF CONTROL TO A NEW TEST WITH PREFATORY EXCUSES I INFORMED HER THAT I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DINE AT HOME AS USUAL IMPOSSIBLE AS IT WAS THAT SHE COULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO HEAR THIS
5022-29411-0041 ON THE RIVER MARGIN OF THE WOOD I WAS CONFRONTED BY A WILD GLEAM OF BEAUTY IN THE FAMILIAR VIEW FOR WHICH PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE HAD NOT PREPARED ME AM I WRONG IN BELIEVING THAT ALL SCENERY NO MATTER HOW MAGNIFICENT OR HOW HOMELY IT MAY BE
5022-29411-0042 DERIVES A SPLENDOR NOT ITS OWN FROM FAVOURING CONDITIONS OF LIGHT AND SHADE OUR GLOOMY TREES AND OUR REPELLENT RIVER PRESENTED AN ASPECT SUPERBLY TRANSFIGURED UNDER THE SHADOWS OF THE TOWERING CLOUDS THE FANTASTIC WREATHS OF THE MIST
5022-29411-0043 AND THE LURID REDDENING OF THE SUN AS IT STOOPED TO ITS SETTING LOVELY INTERFUSIONS OF SOBERED COLOR RESTED FADED RETURNED AGAIN ON THE UPPER LEAVES OF THE FOLIAGE AS THEY LIGHTLY MOVED THE MIST ROLLING CAPRICIOUSLY OVER THE WATERS
5022-29411-0044 WHILE IT DIMMED THE TURBID EARTHY YELLOW THAT DISCOLORED AND DEGRADED THE STREAM UNDER THE FULL GLARE OF DAY WHILE MY EYES FOLLOWED THE SUCCESSIVE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE VIEW AS THE HOUR ADVANCED TENDER AND SOLEMN INFLUENCES BREATHED THEIR BALM OVER MY MIND
5022-29411-0045 DAYS HAPPY DAYS THAT WERE PAST REVIVED AGAIN I WALKED HAND IN HAND WITH MY MOTHER AMONG THE SCENES THAT WERE ROUND ME AND LEARNT FROM HER TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE EARTH WITH A HEART THAT FELT IT
5022-29411-0046 WE WERE TRACING OUR WAY ALONG OUR FAVORITE WOODLAND PATH AND WE FOUND A COMPANION OF TENDER YEARS HIDING FROM US SHE SHOWED HERSELF BLUSHING HESITATING OFFERING A NOSEGAY OF WILD FLOWERS MY MOTHER WHISPERED TO ME
5022-29411-0047 I THANKED THE LITTLE MILL GIRL AND GAVE HER A KISS DID I FEEL THE CHILD'S BREATH IN MY DAY DREAM STILL FLUTTERING ON MY CHEEK WAS I CONSCIOUS OF HER TOUCH I STARTED TREMBLED RETURNED RELUCTANTLY TO MY PRESENT SELF
5022-29411-0048 A VISIBLE HAND TOUCHED MY ARM AS I TURNED SUDDENLY A LIVING BREATH PLAYED ON MY FACE THE CHILD HAD FADED INTO A VANISHING SHADE THE PERFECTED WOMAN WHO HAD GROWN FROM HER HAD STOLEN ON ME UNAWARES AND WAS ASKING ME TO PARDON HER
5022-29411-0049 MISTER GERARD YOU WERE LOST IN YOUR THOUGHTS I SPOKE AND YOU NEVER HEARD ME I LOOKED AT HER IN SILENCE WAS THIS THE DEAR CRISTEL SO WELL KNOWN TO ME OR WAS IT A MOCKERY OF HER THAT HAD TAKEN HER PLACE
5022-29411-0050 YOU HAVE SURPRISED ME I ANSWERED SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED SINCE I SAW YOU LAST WHAT IS IT NOTHING I ADVANCED A STEP AND DREW HER CLOSER TO ME A DARK FLUSH DISCOLORED HER FACE AN OVERPOWERING BRILLIANCY FLASHED FROM HER EYES
5022-29411-0051 THERE WAS AN HYSTERICAL DEFIANCE IN HER MANNER ARE YOU EXCITED ARE YOU ANGRY ARE YOU TRYING TO STARTLE ME BY ACTING A PART I URGED THOSE QUESTIONS ON HER ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND I WAS LOUDLY AND CONFIDENTLY ANSWERED
5022-29411-0052 THE DEAF GENTLEMAN SUBMITTED WHY DID YOU INVITE YOURSELF BECAUSE A TEA PARTY IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT A WOMAN HER MANNER WAS AS STRANGELY ALTERED AS HER LOOKS THAT SHE WAS BESIDE HERSELF FOR THE MOMENT I CLEARLY SAW
5022-29411-0053 I KNOW THAT SHE HAS VISITED YOU AND SPOKEN TO YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE HAS SAID I CAN GUESS
5022-29411-0054 HER MANNER HAD BECOME QUIETER HER FACE WAS MORE COMPOSED HER EXPRESSION ALMOST RECOVERED ITS NATURAL CHARM WHILE SHE SPOKE OF LADY RACHEL I WAS STUPEFIED TRY SIR TO FORGET IT AND FORGIVE IT SHE RESUMED GENTLY
5022-29411-0055 IF I HAVE MISBEHAVED MYSELF I DON'T RIGHTLY KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING OR DOING I POINTED TO THE NEW SIDE OF THE COTTAGE BEHIND US IS THE CAUSE THERE I ASKED NO NO INDEED
5022-29411-0056 IN THAT SHORT TIME I TOLD HER THAT HE HAD BEEN FOUND IN MY GARDEN LOOKING AT THE FLOWERS AS HE HAD DONE NO HARM I SAID
5022-29411-0057 AND FELT I DON'T DOUBT IT I HAD INTENDED TO SAY NO MORE THAN THIS BUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF GLOODY'S MYSTERIOUS PREVARICATION AND OF THE UNEASINESS WHICH I HAD UNDOUBTEDLY FELT WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AFTERWARDS LED ME I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY HOW
5022-29411-0058 INTO ASSOCIATING CRISTEL'S AGITATION WITH SOMETHING WHICH THIS MAN MIGHT HAVE SAID TO HER I WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING THE QUESTION WHEN SHE HELD UP HER HAND AND SAID HUSH THE WIND WAS BLOWING TOWARDS US FROM THE RIVER SIDE VILLAGE TO WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED
5022-29411-0059 I AM NOT SURE WHETHER I HAVE MENTIONED THAT THE NAME OF THE PLACE WAS KYLAM IT WAS SITUATED BEHIND A PROMONTORY OF THE RIVER BANK CLOTHED THICKLY WITH TREES AND WAS NOT VISIBLE FROM THE MILL IN THE PRESENT DIRECTION OF THE WIND WE COULD HEAR THE STRIKING OF THE CHURCH CLOCK
5022-29411-0060 CRISTEL COUNTED THE STROKES SEVEN SHE SAID ARE YOU DETERMINED TO KEEP YOUR ENGAGEMENT SHE HAD REPEATED IN AN UNSTEADY VOICE AND WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE IN HER COLOR TO PALENESS THE STRANGE QUESTION PUT TO ME BY GLOODY
5022-29411-0061 IN HIS CASE I HAD FAILED TO TRACE THE MOTIVE I TRIED TO DISCOVER IT NOW TELL ME WHY I OUGHT TO BREAK MY ENGAGEMENT I SAID REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU AT THE SPRING SHE ANSWERED
5022-29411-0062 YOU ARE DECEIVED BY A FALSE FRIEND WHO LIES TO YOU AND HATES YOU THE MAN SHE WAS SPEAKING OF TURNED THE CORNER OF THE NEW COTTAGE
5022-29411-0063 IT'S TOO LATE NOW INSTEAD OF LETTING ME PRECEDE HER AS I HAD ANTICIPATED SHE RAN ON BEFORE ME MADE A SIGN TO THE DEAF MAN AS SHE PASSED HIM NOT TO STOP HER AND DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR OF HER FATHER'S SIDE OF THE COTTAGE
5022-29411-0064 I WAS LEFT TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE IF I HAD BEEN TWENTY YEARS OLDER
5022-29411-0065 THE FEAR OF APPEARING TO BE AFRAID AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE MADE MY EXCUSES TO MY HOST OF THE EVENING HOW WOULD MY MORAL COURAGE HAVE ANSWERED HIM IF HE HAD ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION USELESS TO SPECULATE ON IT HAD I POSSESSED THE WISDOM OF MIDDLE LIFE
5022-29411-0066 HIS BOOK OF LEAVES WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD HIM IN MY OWN HANDWRITING THAT I BELIEVED IN HIS BETTER NATURE
5022-29411-0067 EXPLAIN IT WHO CAN I KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO DRINK TEA WITH HIM AND YET I WAS UNWILLING TO ADVANCE A FEW STEPS AND MEET HIM ON THE ROAD I FIND A NEW BOND OF UNION BETWEEN US HE SAID AS HE JOINED ME WE BOTH FEEL THAT
5022-29411-0068 HE POINTED TO THE GRANDLY DARKENING VIEW THE TWO MEN WHO COULD HAVE PAINTED THE MYSTERY OF THOSE GROWING SHADOWS AND FADING LIGHTS LIE IN THE GRAVES OF REMBRANDT AND TURNER SHALL WE GO TO TEA ON OUR WAY TO HIS ROOM WE STOPPED AT THE MILLER'S DOOR
5022-29411-0069 WILL YOU INQUIRE HE SAID IF MISS CRISTEL IS READY I WENT IN OLD TOLLER WAS IN THE KITCHEN SMOKING HIS PIPE WITHOUT APPEARING TO ENJOY IT WHAT'S COME TO MY GIRL HE ASKED THE MOMENT HE SAW ME
5022-29411-0070 TO DAY SHE'S IN HER ROOM PRAYING THE WARNINGS WHICH I HAD NEGLECTED ROSE IN JUDGMENT AGAINST ME I WAS SILENT I WAS AWED BEFORE I RECOVERED MYSELF CRISTEL ENTERED THE KITCHEN HER FATHER WHISPERED
5049-25947-0000 THE ROUGH RIDERS AT GUASIMAS ON THE DAY THE AMERICAN TROOPS LANDED ON THE COAST OF CUBA THE CUBANS INFORMED GENERAL WHEELER
5049-25947-0001 BLOCKING THE WAY TO SANTIAGO
5049-25947-0002 NOR EVEN A COLLECTION OF HOUSES IT IS THE MEETING PLACE OF TWO TRAILS WHICH JOIN AT THE APEX OF A V THREE MILES FROM THE SEAPORT TOWN OF SIBONEY AND CONTINUE MERGED IN A SINGLE TRAIL TO SANTIAGO
5049-25947-0003 GENERAL WHEELER GUIDED BY THE CUBANS RECONNOITRED THIS TRAIL ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE AND WITH THE POSITION OF THE ENEMY FULLY EXPLAINED TO HIM RETURNED TO SIBONEY AND INFORMED GENERAL YOUNG AND COLONEL WOOD
5049-25947-0004 THAT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WOULD ATTACK THE SPANISH POSITION
5049-25947-0005 AND WHAT HE WAS TO DO WHEN HE FOUND HIM THAT NIGHT NO ONE SLEPT FOR UNTIL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TROOPS WERE STILL BEING DISEMBARKED IN THE SURF AND TWO SHIPS OF WAR HAD THEIR SEARCHLIGHTS TURNED ON THE LANDING PLACE
5049-25947-0006 LAY THE CAMP OF THE ROUGH RIDERS AND THROUGH IT CUBAN OFFICERS WERE RIDING THEIR HALF STARVED PONIES AND SCATTERING THE ASHES OF THE CAMP FIRES
5049-25947-0007 BELOW THEM WAS THE BEACH AND THE ROARING SURF IN WHICH A THOUSAND OR SO NAKED MEN WERE ASSISTING AND IMPEDING THE PROGRESS SHOREWARD OF THEIR COMRADES IN PONTOONS AND SHORE BOATS
5049-25947-0008 WHICH WERE BEING HURLED AT THE BEACH LIKE SLEDS DOWN A WATER CHUTE IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST WEIRD AND REMARKABLE SCENES OF THE WAR PROBABLY OF ANY WAR
