196-122152-0025 RESTED UPON A WHITE MAN WHO SAT APART FROM THE OTHERS WITH HIS FACE WORN AND CLOUDED BUT WITH QUIET EYES THAT GLANCED STRAIGHT INTERESTED AND CLEAR JIM ANSWERED ANOTHER QUESTION AND WAS TEMPTED TO CRY OUT
196-122152-0026 WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THIS WHAT'S THE GOOD HE TAPPED WITH HIS FOOT SLIGHTLY BIT HIS LIP AND LOOKED AWAY OVER THE HEADS HE MET THE EYES OF THE WHITE MAN THE GLANCE DIRECTED AT HIM WAS NOT THE FASCINATED STARE OF THE OTHERS
196-122152-0027 IT WAS AN ACT OF INTELLIGENT VOLITION JIM BETWEEN TWO QUESTIONS FORGOT HIMSELF SO FAR AS TO FIND LEISURE FOR A THOUGHT THIS FELLOW RAN THE THOUGHT LOOKS AT ME AS THOUGH HE COULD SEE SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING PAST MY SHOULDER
196-122152-0028 HE HAD COME ACROSS THAT MAN BEFORE IN THE STREET PERHAPS HE WAS POSITIVE HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM FOR DAYS FOR MANY DAYS HE HAD SPOKEN TO NO ONE BUT HAD HELD SILENT INCOHERENT AND ENDLESS CONVERSE WITH HIMSELF
196-122152-0029 LIKE A PRISONER ALONE IN HIS CELL OR LIKE A WAYFARER LOST IN A WILDERNESS AT PRESENT HE WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT DID NOT MATTER THOUGH THEY HAD A PURPOSE BUT HE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER AGAIN SPEAK OUT AS LONG AS HE LIVED
196-122152-0030 THE SOUND OF HIS OWN TRUTHFUL STATEMENTS CONFIRMED HIS DELIBERATE OPINION THAT SPEECH WAS OF NO USE TO HIM ANY LONGER THAT MAN THERE SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF HIS HOPELESS DIFFICULTY JIM LOOKED AT HIM THEN TURNED AWAY
196-122152-0031 AND AUDIBLY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AFTER DINNER ON A VERANDAH DRAPED IN MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS IN THE DEEP DUSK SPECKLED BY FIERY CIGAR ENDS THE ELONGATED BULK OF EACH CANE CHAIR
196-122152-0032 HARBOURED A SILENT LISTENER NOW AND THEN A SMALL RED GLOW WOULD MOVE ABRUPTLY AND EXPANDING LIGHT UP THE FINGERS OF A LANGUID HAND PART OF A FACE IN PROFOUND REPOSE OR FLASH A CRIMSON GLEAM INTO A PAIR OF PENSIVE EYES
196-122152-0033 OVERSHADOWED BY A FRAGMENT OF AN UNRUFFLED FOREHEAD AND WITH THE VERY FIRST WORD UTTERED MARLOW'S BODY EXTENDED AT REST IN THE SEAT WOULD BECOME VERY STILL AS THOUGH HIS SPIRIT HAD WINGED ITS WAY BACK INTO THE LAPSE OF TIME
196-122159-0000 AT HIS BACK WAS THE DARK NIGHT WITH THE CLEAR STARS WHOSE DISTANT GLITTER DISPOSED IN RETREATING PLANES LURED THE EYE INTO THE DEPTHS OF A GREATER DARKNESS
196-122159-0001 AND YET A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT SEEMED TO SHOW ME HIS BOYISH HEAD AS IF IN THAT MOMENT THE YOUTH WITHIN HIM HAD FOR A MOMENT GLOWED AND EXPIRED YOU ARE AN AWFUL GOOD SORT TO LISTEN
196-122159-0002 LIKE THIS HE SAID IT DOES ME GOOD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME YOU DON'T WORDS SEEMED TO FAIL HIM IT WAS A DISTINCT GLIMPSE HE WAS A YOUNGSTER OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO SEE ABOUT YOU
196-122159-0003 OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO IMAGINE YOURSELF TO HAVE BEEN OF THE SORT WHOSE APPEARANCE CLAIMS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THESE ILLUSIONS YOU HAD THOUGHT GONE OUT EXTINCT COLD AND WHICH AS IF REKINDLED AT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER FLAME
196-122159-0004 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR A FELLOW IN MY POSITION TO BE BELIEVED MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO AN ELDER MAN IT IS SO DIFFICULT SO AWFULLY UNFAIR SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
196-122159-0005 THE MISTS WERE CLOSING AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD I APPEARED TO HIM AND HOW MUCH WISE NOT HALF AS OLD AS I FELT JUST THEN NOT HALF AS USELESSLY WISE AS I KNEW MYSELF TO BE
196-122159-0006 SURELY IN NO OTHER CRAFT AS IN THAT OF THE SEA DO THE HEARTS OF THOSE ALREADY LAUNCHED TO SINK OR SWIM GO OUT SO MUCH TO THE YOUTH ON THE BRINK LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES UPON THAT
196-122159-0007 GLITTER OF THE VAST SURFACE WHICH IS ONLY A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN GLANCES FULL OF FIRE THERE IS SUCH MAGNIFICENT VAGUENESS IN THE EXPECTATIONS THAT HAD DRIVEN EACH OF US TO SEA SUCH A GLORIOUS INDEFINITENESS
196-122159-0008 SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GREED OF ADVENTURES THAT ARE THEIR OWN AND ONLY REWARD WHAT WE GET WELL WE WON'T TALK OF THAT BUT CAN ONE OF US RESTRAIN A SMILE
196-122159-0009 IN NO OTHER KIND OF LIFE IS THE ILLUSION MORE WIDE OF REALITY IN NO OTHER IS THE BEGINNING ALL ILLUSION THE DISENCHANTMENT MORE SWIFT THE SUBJUGATION MORE COMPLETE
196-122159-0010 HADN'T WE ALL COMMENCED WITH THE SAME DESIRE ENDED WITH THE SAME KNOWLEDGE CARRIED THE MEMORY OF THE SAME CHERISHED GLAMOUR THROUGH THE SORDID DAYS OF IMPRECATION WHAT WONDER THAT WHEN SOME
196-122159-0011 HEAVY PROD GETS HOME THE BOND IS FOUND TO BE CLOSE THAT BESIDES THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CRAFT THERE IS FELT THE STRENGTH OF A WIDER FEELING THE FEELING THAT BINDS A MAN TO A CHILD HE WAS THERE BEFORE ME BELIEVING THAT
196-122159-0012 AND HE HAD BEEN DELIBERATING UPON DEATH CONFOUND HIM HE HAD FOUND THAT TO MEDITATE ABOUT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE WHILE ALL ITS GLAMOUR HAD GONE WITH THE SHIP IN THE NIGHT WHAT MORE NATURAL
196-122159-0013 AND HIS VOICE SPOKE I WAS SO LOST YOU KNOW IT WAS THE SORT OF THING ONE DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAPPEN TO ONE IT WAS NOT LIKE A FIGHT FOR INSTANCE
196-122159-0014 HE APPEARED CHANGED AS IF HE HAD SUDDENLY MATURED ONE COULDN'T BE SURE HE MUTTERED AH YOU WERE NOT SURE I SAID
196-122159-0015 AND WAS PLACATED BY THE SOUND OF A FAINT SIGH THAT PASSED BETWEEN US LIKE THE FLIGHT OF A BIRD IN THE NIGHT WELL I WASN'T HE SAID COURAGEOUSLY IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRETCHED STORY THEY MADE UP IT WAS NOT A LIE
196-122159-0016 BUT IT WASN'T TRUTH ALL THE SAME IT WAS SOMETHING ONE KNOWS A DOWNRIGHT LIE THERE WAS NOT THE THICKNESS OF A SHEET OF PAPER BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF THIS AFFAIR
196-122159-0017 HOW MUCH MORE DID YOU WANT I ASKED BUT I THINK I SPOKE SO LOW THAT HE DID NOT CATCH WHAT I SAID HE HAD ADVANCED HIS ARGUMENT AS THOUGH LIFE HAD BEEN A NETWORK OF
196-122159-0018 HIS VOICE SOUNDED REASONABLE SUPPOSE I HAD NOT I MEAN TO SAY SUPPOSE I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP WELL HOW MUCH LONGER SAY A MINUTE HALF A MINUTE
196-122159-0019 I INTERJECTED I WOULD HAVE MEANT TO BE HE RETORTED AND THAT'S MORE THAN I MEANT WHEN I HE SHIVERED AS IF ABOUT TO SWALLOW SOME NAUSEOUS DRUG JUMPED
196-122159-0020 HE PRONOUNCED WITH A CONVULSIVE EFFORT WHOSE STRESS AS IF PROPAGATED BY THE WAVES OF THE AIR MADE MY BODY STIR A LITTLE IN THE CHAIR HE FIXED ME WITH LOWERING EYES DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME HE CRIED I SWEAR
196-122159-0021 I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN I AM I AM A GENTLEMAN TOO YES YES I SAID HASTILY HE WAS LOOKING ME SQUARELY IN THE FACE AND WITHDREW HIS GAZE SLOWLY
196-122159-0022 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I DIDN'T AFTER ALL DIDN'T GO OUT IN THAT WAY I WASN'T GOING TO BE FRIGHTENED AT WHAT I HAD DONE AND ANYHOW IF I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP I WOULD HAVE DONE MY BEST TO BE SAVED
196-122159-0023 MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO FLOAT FOR HOURS IN THE OPEN SEA AND BE PICKED UP NOT MUCH THE WORSE FOR IT I MIGHT HAVE LASTED IT OUT BETTER THAN MANY OTHERS THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH MY HEART
196-122159-0024 A HAIR'S BREADTH HE MUTTERED NOT THE BREADTH OF A HAIR BETWEEN THIS AND THAT AND AT THE TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE A HAIR AT MIDNIGHT I PUT IN
196-122159-0025 A LITTLE VICIOUSLY I FEAR DON'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CRAFT I WAS AGGRIEVED AGAINST HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CHEATED ME
196-122159-0026 KEEP UP THE ILLUSION OF MY BEGINNINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD ROBBED OUR COMMON LIFE OF THE LAST SPARK OF ITS GLAMOUR AND SO YOU CLEARED OUT AT ONCE JUMPED HE CORRECTED ME INCISIVELY JUMPED MIND
196-122159-0027 HE REPEATED AND I WONDERED AT THE EVIDENT BUT OBSCURE INTENTION WELL YES PERHAPS I COULD NOT SEE THEN BUT I HAD PLENTY OF TIME AND ANY AMOUNT OF LIGHT IN THAT BOAT AND I COULD THINK TOO
196-122159-0028 NOBODY WOULD KNOW OF COURSE BUT THIS DID NOT MAKE IT ANY EASIER FOR ME YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT TOO I DID NOT WANT ALL THIS TALK NO YES I WON'T LIE
196-122159-0029 I WANTED IT IT IS THE VERY THING I WANTED THERE DO YOU THINK YOU OR ANYBODY COULD HAVE MADE ME IF I I AM I AM NOT AFRAID TO TELL AND I WASN'T AFRAID TO THINK EITHER I LOOKED IT IN THE FACE
196-122159-0030 I WASN'T GOING TO RUN AWAY AT FIRST AT NIGHT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THOSE FELLOWS I MIGHT HAVE NO BY HEAVENS I WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM THAT SATISFACTION THEY HAD DONE ENOUGH THEY MADE UP A STORY AND BELIEVED IT FOR ALL I KNOW
196-122159-0031 BUT I KNEW THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LIVE IT DOWN ALONE WITH MYSELF I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IN TO SUCH A BEASTLY UNFAIR THING WHAT DID IT PROVE AFTER ALL I WAS CONFOUNDEDLY CUT UP SICK OF LIFE
196-122159-0032 NO THE PROPER THING WAS TO FACE IT OUT ALONE FOR MYSELF WAIT FOR ANOTHER CHANCE
198-126831-0000 FRIDAY WAS A COMFORTABLE DAY IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF KING EVERYBODY WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR THE STORY GIRL SPARKLED THROUGH SEVERAL TALES THAT RANGED FROM THE AFRITES AND JINNS OF EASTERN MYTH THROUGH THE PIPING DAYS OF CHIVALRY DOWN TO THE HOMELY ANECDOTES OF CARLISLE WORKADAY FOLKS
198-126831-0001 SHE WAS IN TURN AN ORIENTAL PRINCESS BEHIND A SILKEN VEIL THE BRIDE WHO FOLLOWED HER BRIDEGROOM TO THE WARS OF PALESTINE DISGUISED AS A PAGE THE GALLANT LADY WHO RANSOMED HER DIAMOND NECKLACE BY DANCING A CORANTO
198-126831-0002 WITH A HIGHWAYMAN ON A MOONLIT HEATH AND BUSKIRK'S GIRL WHO JOINED THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF TEMPERANCE JUST TO SEE WHAT WAS INTO IT AND IN EACH IMPERSONATION SHE WAS SO THOROUGHLY THE THING IMPERSONATED
198-126831-0003 CECILY AND SARA RAY FOUND A SWEET NEW KNITTED LACE PATTERN IN AN OLD MAGAZINE
198-126831-0004 CHANCING ACCIDENTALLY I VOW TO OVERHEAR CERTAIN OF THESE SECRETS I LEARNED THAT SARA RAY HAD NAMED AN APPLE FOR JOHNNY PRICE AND CECILY TRUE'S YOU LIVE THERE WAS EIGHT SEEDS IN IT AND YOU KNOW EIGHT MEANS THEY BOTH LOVE
198-126831-0005 WHILE CECILY ADMITTED THAT WILLY FRASER HAD WRITTEN ON HIS SLATE AND SHOWED IT TO HER IF YOU LOVE ME AS I LOVE YOU NO KNIFE CAN CUT OUR LOVE IN TWO BUT SARA RAY NEVER YOU BREATHE THIS TO A LIVING SOUL
198-126831-0006 CECILY HOW OLD MUST WE BE BEFORE WE CAN HAVE A REAL BEAU BUT SARA ALWAYS DENIED IT SO I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE FELIX SIMPLY MADE IT UP HIMSELF PADDY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF BY CATCHING A RAT
198-126831-0007 AND BEING INTOLERABLY CONCEITED ABOUT IT UNTIL SARA RAY CURED HIM BY CALLING HIM A DEAR SWEET CAT AND KISSING HIM BETWEEN THE EARS THEN PAT SNEAKED ABJECTLY OFF HIS TAIL DROOPING
198-126831-0008 VERY FEW CATS HAVE AND MOST OF THEM HAVE SUCH AN INORDINATE APPETITE FOR FLATTERY THAT THEY WILL SWALLOW ANY AMOUNT OF IT AND THRIVE THEREON PADDY HAD A FINER TASTE THE STORY GIRL AND I WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD PAY HIM COMPLIMENTS TO HIS LIKING
198-126831-0009 THE STORY GIRL WOULD BOX HIS EARS WITH HER FIST AND SAY BLESS YOUR GRAY HEART PADDY YOU'RE A GOOD SORT OF OLD RASCAL AND PAT WOULD PURR HIS SATISFACTION I USED TO TAKE A HANDFUL OF THE SKIN ON HIS BACK SHAKE HIM GENTLY AND SAY
198-126831-0010 PAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN MORE THAN ANY HUMAN BEING EVER KNEW AND I VOW PADDY WOULD LICK HIS CHOPS WITH DELIGHT BUT TO BE CALLED A SWEET CAT OH SARA SARA
198-126831-0011 FELICITY TRIED AND HAD THE MOST GRATIFYING LUCK WITH A NEW AND COMPLICATED CAKE RECIPE A GORGEOUS COMPOUND
198-126831-0012 THE NUMBER OF EGGS SHE USED IN IT WOULD HAVE SHOCKED AUNT JANET'S THRIFTY SOUL BUT THAT CAKE LIKE BEAUTY WAS ITS OWN EXCUSE UNCLE ROGER ATE THREE SLICES OF IT AT TEA TIME AND TOLD FELICITY SHE WAS AN ARTIST
198-126831-0013 THE POOR MAN MEANT IT AS A COMPLIMENT BUT FELICITY WHO KNEW UNCLE BLAIR WAS AN ARTIST AND HAD A POOR OPINION OF SUCH FRY LOOKED INDIGNANT AND RETORTED INDEED SHE WASN'T
198-126831-0014 I'D LIKE TO SIGHED FELICITY BUT WE'D COME HOME TIRED AND WITH ALL THE MILKING TO DO YOU BOYS BETTER GO ALONE PETER AND I WILL ATTEND TO THE MILKING FOR ONE EVENING SAID UNCLE ROGER YOU CAN ALL GO
198-126831-0015 I HAVE AN IDEA THAT A RASPBERRY PIE FOR TO MORROW NIGHT WHEN THE FOLKS COME HOME WOULD HIT THE RIGHT SPOT ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA WE ALL SET OFF ARMED WITH JUGS AND CUPS FELICITY THOUGHTFUL CREATURE ALSO TOOK A SMALL BASKETFUL OF JELLY COOKIES ALONG WITH HER
198-126831-0016 A PRETTY WALK THROUGH A WORLD OF GREEN WHISPERING BOUGHS AND SPICE SWEET FERNS AND SHIFTING PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT THE RASPBERRIES WERE PLENTIFUL
198-126831-0017 THEN WE FOREGATHERED AROUND A TINY WOOD SPRING COLD AND PELLUCID UNDER ITS YOUNG MAPLES AND ATE THE JELLY COOKIES AND THE STORY GIRL TOLD US A TALE OF A HAUNTED SPRING IN A MOUNTAIN GLEN WHERE A FAIR WHITE LADY DWELT
198-126831-0018 WHO PLEDGED ALL COMERS IN A GOLDEN CUP WITH JEWELS BRIGHT AND IF YOU DRANK OF THE CUP WITH HER SAID THE STORY GIRL HER EYES GLOWING THROUGH THE EMERALD DUSK ABOUT US YOU WERE NEVER SEEN IN THE WORLD AGAIN YOU WERE WHISKED STRAIGHTWAY TO FAIRYLAND AND LIVED THERE WITH A FAIRY BRIDE
198-126831-0019 I THINK THERE IS SUCH A PLACE IN SPITE OF UNCLE EDWARD SAID THE STORY GIRL DREAMILY AND I THINK THERE IS A WAY OF GETTING THERE TOO IF WE COULD ONLY FIND IT
198-126831-0020 ONE BITTER DAY WHEN THEY SEEK IT
198-126831-0021 AND THAT IS THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE ON THAT DAY THE GATES OF EDEN ARE SHUT BEHIND THEM AND THE AGE OF GOLD IS OVER HENCEFORTH THEY MUST DWELL IN THE COMMON LIGHT OF COMMON DAY ONLY A FEW WHO REMAIN CHILDREN AT HEART CAN EVER FIND THAT FAIR LOST PATH AGAIN
198-126831-0022 THEY AND ONLY THEY CAN BRING US TIDINGS FROM THAT DEAR COUNTRY WHERE WE ONCE SOJOURNED AND FROM WHICH WE MUST EVERMORE BE EXILES THE WORLD CALLS THEM ITS SINGERS AND POETS AND ARTISTS AND STORY TELLERS
198-126831-0023 AS WE SAT THERE THE AWKWARD MAN PASSED BY WITH HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HIS DOG AT HIS SIDE HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE AN AWKWARD MAN THERE IN THE HEART OF THE MAPLE WOODS
198-126831-0024 HE STRODE ALONG RIGHT MASTERFULLY AND LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO WAS MONARCH OF ALL HE SURVEYED THE STORY GIRL KISSED HER FINGERTIPS TO HIM WITH THE DELIGHTFUL AUDACITY WHICH WAS A PART OF HER
198-126831-0025 YOU'D UNDERSTAND WHY IF YOU EVER SAW HIM AT A PARTY OR A PICNIC SAID FELICITY TRYING TO PASS PLATES AND DROPPING THEM WHENEVER A WOMAN LOOKED AT HIM THEY SAY IT'S PITIFUL TO SEE HIM I MUST GET WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THAT MAN NEXT SUMMER SAID THE STORY GIRL
198-126831-0026 IF I PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER IT WILL BE TOO LATE I'M GROWING SO FAST AUNT OLIVIA SAYS I'LL HAVE TO WEAR ANKLE SKIRTS NEXT SUMMER IF I BEGIN TO LOOK GROWN UP HE'LL GET FRIGHTENED OF ME AND THEN I'LL NEVER FIND OUT THE GOLDEN MILESTONE MYSTERY
198-126831-0027 DO YOU THINK HE'LL EVER TELL YOU WHO ALICE IS I ASKED I HAVE A NOTION WHO ALICE IS ALREADY SAID THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURE BUT SHE WOULD TELL US NOTHING MORE WHEN THE JELLY COOKIES WERE ALL EATEN IT WAS HIGH TIME TO BE MOVING HOMEWARD
198-126831-0028 AND THE PRECINCTS OF A POSSIBLY ENCHANTED SPRING WHEN WE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE ORCHARD AND ENTERED IT THROUGH A GAP IN THE HEDGE IT WAS THE MAGICAL MYSTICAL TIME OF BETWEEN LIGHTS OFF TO THE WEST WAS A DAFFODIL GLOW HANGING OVER THE VALLEY OF LOST SUNSETS
198-126831-0029 AND I GOT BACK ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO I SET DOWN ON THE FRONT DOOR STEPS FOR A MOMENT AND ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A BELL RING IN THE HOUSE EIGHT TIMES I TELL YOU I WAS SKEERED I MADE A BOLT FOR THE ORCHARD AND YOU WON'T CATCH ME GOING NEAR THAT HOUSE TILL YOUR UNCLE ROGER COMES HOME
198-126831-0030 THERE WE STOOD IN A HUDDLED DEMORALIZED GROUP OH WHAT AN EERIE PLACE THAT ORCHARD WAS WHAT SHADOWS WHAT NOISES
198-126831-0031 WELL HERE'S THE KEY GO AND SEE FOR YOURSELF SAID PETER FELICITY HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING AND SEEING I THINK YOU BOYS OUGHT TO GO SHE SAID RETREATING BEHIND THE DEFENCE OF SEX YOU OUGHT TO BE BRAVER THAN GIRLS
198-126831-0032 SOMEBODY KILLED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING LIKE THAT EVER HAPPENED IN OUR FAMILY THE KINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RESPECTABLE PERHAPS IT IS EMILY
198-126831-0033 KING'S GHOST WHISPERED FELIX SHE NEVER APPEARED ANYWHERE BUT IN THE ORCHARD SAID THE STORY GIRL OH OH CHILDREN ISN'T THERE SOMETHING UNDER UNCLE ALEC'S TREE WE PEERED FEARFULLY THROUGH THE GLOOM THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT WAVERED AND FLUTTERED ADVANCED RETREATED
198-126831-0034 THAT'S ONLY MY OLD APRON SAID FELICITY I HUNG IT THERE TO DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR THE WHITE HEN'S NEST OH WHAT SHALL WE DO UNCLE ROGER MAY NOT BE BACK FOR HOURS I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE MAYBE IT'S ONLY PEG BOWEN SUGGESTED DAN
198-126831-0035 THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF COMFORT IN THIS WE WERE ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF PEG BOWEN AS WE WOULD BE OF ANY SPECTRAL VISITANT PETER SCOFFED AT THE IDEA PEG BOWEN WASN'T IN THE HOUSE BEFORE YOUR UNCLE ROGER LOCKED IT UP AND HOW COULD SHE GET IN AFTERWARDS HE SAID
198-126831-0036 NO IT ISN'T PEG BOWEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WALKS I KNOW A STORY ABOUT A GHOST SAID THE STORY GIRL THE RULING PASSION STRONG EVEN IN EXTREMITY IT IS ABOUT A GHOST WITH EYEHOLES BUT NO EYES
198-126831-0037 DON'T CRIED CECILY HYSTERICALLY DON'T YOU GO ON DON'T YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD I CAN'T BEAR IT DON'T YOU THE STORY GIRL DIDN'T BUT SHE HAD SAID ENOUGH
198-126831-0038 ALL AT ONCE SOMETHING LEAPED FROM THE BOUGH OF A TREE AND ALIGHTED BEFORE US WE SPLIT THE AIR WITH A SIMULTANEOUS SHRIEK
198-126831-0039 HE STRUGGLED OUT OF MY CLASP AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE LONG GRASSES WITH SOUNDLESS LEAPS
198-126831-0040 HE WAS A STRANGE FURTIVE ANIMAL A QUESTING BEAST PRESENTLY THE MOON ROSE BUT THIS ONLY MADE MATTERS WORSE THE SHADOWS HAD BEEN STILL BEFORE NOW THEY MOVED AND DANCED AS THE NIGHT WIND TOSSED THE BOUGHS THE OLD HOUSE WITH ITS DREADFUL SECRET
198-126831-0041 WAS WHITE AND CLEAR AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF SPRUCES WE WERE WOEFULLY TIRED BUT WE COULD NOT SIT DOWN BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS REEKING WITH DEW THE FAMILY GHOST ONLY APPEARS IN DAYLIGHT SAID THE STORY GIRL
198-126831-0042 I KNOW HE'LL LAUGH AT US AWFUL BUT IT'S BETTER TO BE LAUGHED AT THAN SCARED LIKE THIS UNCLE ROGER DID NOT COME UNTIL NEARLY TEN NEVER WAS THERE A MORE WELCOME SOUND THAN THE RUMBLE OF HIS WHEELS IN THE LANE
198-126831-0043 WE RAN TO THE ORCHARD GATE AND SWARMED ACROSS THE YARD JUST AS UNCLE ROGER ALIGHTED AT THE FRONT DOOR HE STARED AT US IN THE MOONLIGHT
198-126831-0044 THERE'S NO USE ASKING THE MEANING OF THIS I SUPPOSE SAID UNCLE ROGER WITH THE CALM OF DESPAIR I'VE GAVE UP TRYING TO FATHOM YOU YOUNG ONES PETER WHERE'S THE KEY WHAT YARN HAVE YOU BEEN TELLING
198-126831-0045 UNCLE ROGER UNLOCKED AND FLUNG OPEN THE FRONT DOOR AS HE DID SO CLEAR AND SWEET RANG OUT TEN BELL LIKE CHIMES
198-126831-0046 WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL UNCLE ROGER STOPPED LAUGHING BEFORE WE HEARD THE EXPLANATION WE THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD STOP
198-126831-0047 AND NOW IT HAS ALMOST FRIGHTENED YOU POOR LITTLE MONKEYS TO DEATH WE HEARD UNCLE ROGER CHUCKLING ALL THE WAY TO THE BARN
198-126831-0048 I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WOULDN'T MIND IF HE'D LAUGH ONCE AND HAVE IT DONE WITH IT
198-126831-0049 I SHALL TELL IT TOO I DON'T CARE IF THE JOKE IS AS MUCH ON MYSELF AS ANY ONE A STORY IS A STORY NO MATTER WHO IT'S ON BUT IT IS HATEFUL TO BE LAUGHED AT AND GROWN UPS ALWAYS DO IT I NEVER WILL WHEN I'M GROWN UP I'LL REMEMBER BETTER
198-126831-0050 IT'S ALL PETER'S FAULT SAID FELICITY I DO THINK HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE SENSE THAN TO TAKE A CLOCK STRIKING FOR A BELL RINGING
198-126831-0051 IT DON'T SOUND A BIT LIKE OTHER CLOCKS
198-126831-0052 I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THE STORY GIRL HONESTLY I THOUGHT IT WAS A BELL WHEN I HEARD IT AND THE DOOR OPEN TOO LET US BE FAIR FELICITY
198-126831-0053 BUT IT WAS OVER TWO HOURS SINCE WE HAD EATEN THE COOKIES AND FELICITY SUGGESTED THAT A SAUCERFUL APIECE
198-129977-0000 ELINOR SAW WITH GREAT UNEASINESS THE LOW SPIRITS OF HER FRIEND HIS VISIT AFFORDED HER BUT A VERY PARTIAL SATISFACTION
198-129977-0001 WHILE HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN IT APPEARED SO IMPERFECT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY SHE WISHED IT WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT HE STILL DISTINGUISHED HER BY THE SAME AFFECTION WHICH ONCE SHE HAD FELT NO DOUBT OF INSPIRING
198-129977-0002 BUT HITHERTO THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS PREFERENCE SEEMED VERY UNCERTAIN AND THE RESERVEDNESS OF HIS MANNER TOWARDS HER CONTRADICTED ONE MOMENT WHAT A MORE ANIMATED LOOK HAD INTIMATED THE PRECEDING ONE
198-129977-0003 HE JOINED HER AND MARIANNE IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE OTHERS WERE DOWN AND MARIANNE WHO WAS ALWAYS EAGER TO PROMOTE THEIR HAPPINESS AS FAR AS SHE COULD SOON LEFT THEM TO THEMSELVES BUT BEFORE SHE WAS HALF WAY UPSTAIRS SHE HEARD THE PARLOUR DOOR OPEN
