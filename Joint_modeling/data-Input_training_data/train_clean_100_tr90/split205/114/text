4406-16882-0047 I WISHED HER NOT TO RUN AWAY BY ANY MEANS FOR WE WERE NEAR THIRTY MILES FROM ANY ENGLISH TOWN
4406-16882-0048 AND ANOTHER CHILD IN HER ARMS TWO YEARS OLD AND BAD RIVERS THERE WERE TO GO OVER AND WE WERE FEEBLE WITH OUR POOR AND COARSE ENTERTAINMENT I HAD MY BIBLE WITH ME I PULLED IT OUT AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD READ
4406-16882-0049 BE OF GOOD COURAGE AND HE SHALL STRENGTHEN THINE HEART WAIT I SAY ON THE LORD THE FOURTH REMOVE AND NOW I MUST PART WITH THAT LITTLE COMPANY I HAD
4406-16882-0050 SHE WOULD BE OFTEN ASKING THE INDIANS TO LET HER GO HOME THEY NOT BEING WILLING TO THAT AND YET VEXED WITH HER IMPORTUNITY GATHERED A GREAT COMPANY TOGETHER ABOUT HER AND STRIPPED HER NAKED AND SET HER IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD SUNG AND DANCED ABOUT HER IN THEIR HELLISH MANNER
4406-16882-0051 AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED THEY KNOCKED HER ON HEAD AND THE CHILD IN HER ARMS WITH HER WHEN THEY HAD DONE THAT THEY MADE A FIRE AND PUT THEM BOTH INTO IT
4406-16882-0052 THE CHILDREN SAID SHE DID NOT SHED ONE TEAR BUT PRAYED ALL THE WHILE
4406-16882-0053 WE CAME ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON TO THIS PLACE COLD AND WET AND SNOWY AND HUNGRY AND WEARY AND NO REFRESHING FOR MAN BUT THE COLD GROUND TO SIT ON AND OUR POOR INDIAN CHEER
4406-16882-0054 THIS WAS A SWEET CORDIAL TO ME WHEN I WAS READY TO FAINT MANY AND MANY A TIME HAVE I SAT DOWN AND WEPT SWEETLY OVER THIS SCRIPTURE AT THIS PLACE WE CONTINUED ABOUT FOUR DAYS THE FIFTH REMOVE
4406-16882-0055 AND THEN THEY MADE A STOP AND CHOSE SOME OF THEIR STOUTEST MEN AND SENT THEM BACK TO HOLD THE ENGLISH ARMY IN PLAY WHILST THE REST ESCAPED AND THEN LIKE JEHU THEY MARCHED ON FURIOUSLY WITH THEIR OLD AND WITH THEIR YOUNG SOME CARRIED THEIR OLD DECREPIT MOTHERS
4406-16882-0056 SOME CARRIED ONE AND SOME ANOTHER FOUR OF THEM CARRIED A GREAT INDIAN UPON A BIER BUT GOING THROUGH A THICK WOOD WITH HIM THEY WERE HINDERED AND COULD MAKE NO HASTE WHEREUPON THEY TOOK HIM UPON THEIR BACKS AND CARRIED HIM ONE AT A TIME TILL
4406-16882-0057 UPON A FRIDAY A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE CAME TO THIS RIVER
4406-16882-0058 AND WERE GATHERED TOGETHER I THOUGHT TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF THEM BUT THEY WERE SO MANY AND BEING SOMEWHAT IN MOTION IT WAS BEYOND MY SKILL IN THIS TRAVEL BECAUSE OF MY WOUND I WAS SOMEWHAT FAVORED IN MY LOAD I CARRIED ONLY MY KNITTING WORK AND TWO QUARTS OF PARCHED MEAL
4406-16882-0059 BEING VERY FAINT I ASKED MY MISTRESS TO GIVE ME ONE SPOONFUL OF THE MEAL BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE ME A TASTE THEY QUICKLY FELL TO CUTTING DRY TREES TO MAKE RAFTS TO CARRY THEM OVER THE RIVER AND SOON MY TURN CAME TO GO OVER BY THE ADVANTAGE OF SOME BRUSH
4406-16882-0060 WHICH THEY HAD LAID UPON THE RAFT TO SIT UPON I DID NOT WET MY FOOT WHICH MANY OF THEMSELVES AT THE OTHER END WERE MID LEG DEEP WHICH CANNOT BUT BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A FAVOR OF GOD TO MY WEAKENED BODY IT BEING A VERY COLD TIME I WAS NOT BEFORE ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH
4406-16882-0061 THE FIRST WEEK OF MY BEING AMONG THEM I HARDLY ATE ANY THING THE SECOND WEEK I FOUND MY STOMACH GROW VERY FAINT FOR WANT OF SOMETHING AND YET IT WAS VERY HARD TO GET DOWN THEIR FILTHY TRASH BUT THE THIRD WEEK
4406-16882-0062 I TOLD THEM IT WAS THE SABBATH DAY AND DESIRED THEM TO LET ME REST AND TOLD THEM I WOULD DO AS MUCH MORE TOMORROW TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED ME THEY WOULD BREAK MY FACE AND HERE I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE OF THE STRANGE PROVIDENCE OF GOD IN PRESERVING THE HEATHEN
4406-16882-0063 THEY WERE MANY HUNDREDS OLD AND YOUNG SOME SICK AND SOME LAME MANY HAD PAPOOSES AT THEIR BACKS THE GREATEST NUMBER AT THIS TIME WITH US WERE SQUAWS
4406-16882-0064 IF WE HAD BEEN GOD WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT A WAY FOR THE ENGLISH TO HAVE PASSED THIS RIVER AS WELL AS FOR THE INDIANS WITH THEIR SQUAWS AND CHILDREN AND ALL THEIR LUGGAGE OH THAT MY PEOPLE HAD HEARKENED TO ME AND ISRAEL HAD WALKED IN MY WAYS
4406-16882-0065 THEY SET THEIR WIGWAMS ON FIRE AND WENT AWAY IT WAS A COLD MORNING AND BEFORE US THERE WAS A GREAT BROOK WITH ICE ON IT SOME WADED THROUGH IT UP TO THE KNEES AND HIGHER BUT OTHERS WENT TILL THEY CAME TO A BEAVER DAM AND I AMONGST THEM
4406-16882-0066 WE CAME THAT DAY TO A GREAT SWAMP BY THE SIDE OF WHICH WE TOOK UP OUR LODGING THAT NIGHT WHEN I CAME TO THE BROW OF THE HILL THAT LOOKED TOWARD THE SWAMP I THOUGHT WE HAD BEEN COME TO A GREAT INDIAN TOWN
4406-16882-0067 THOUGH THERE WERE NONE BUT OUR OWN COMPANY THE INDIANS WERE AS THICK AS THE TREES IT SEEMED AS IF THERE HAD BEEN A THOUSAND HATCHETS GOING AT ONCE IF ONE LOOKED BEFORE ONE THERE WAS NOTHING BUT INDIANS AND BEHIND ONE NOTHING BUT INDIANS
4406-16882-0068 AND AN EXCEEDING HIGH AND STEEP HILL BEFORE IT BEFORE I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE HILL I THOUGHT MY HEART AND LEGS AND ALL WOULD HAVE BROKEN AND FAILED ME WHAT THROUGH FAINTNESS AND SORENESS OF BODY IT WAS A GRIEVOUS DAY OF TRAVEL TO ME
4406-16883-0000 AND THE CHANGE THAT HAD COME UPON US WE HAD HUSBAND AND FATHER AND CHILDREN AND SISTERS AND FRIENDS AND RELATIONS AND HOUSE AND HOME AND MANY COMFORTS OF THIS LIFE BUT NOW WE MAY SAY AS JOB
4406-16883-0001 AND HE LIGHTED UPON THAT COMFORTABLE SCRIPTURE I SHALL NOT DIE BUT LIVE AND DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD
4406-16883-0002 EVEN AS THE PSALMIST SAYS TO DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD AND HIS WONDERFUL POWER IN CARRYING US ALONG PRESERVING US IN THE WILDERNESS WHILE UNDER THE ENEMY'S HAND AND RETURNING OF US IN SAFETY AGAIN AND HIS GOODNESS
4406-16883-0003 IN BRINGING TO MY HAND SO MANY COMFORTABLE AND SUITABLE SCRIPTURES IN MY DISTRESS BUT TO RETURN
4406-16883-0004 AND IN THE MORNING WE MUST GO OVER THE RIVER TO PHILIP'S CREW
4406-16883-0005 WHICH WAS THE FIRST TIME TO MY REMEMBRANCE THAT I WEPT BEFORE THEM ALTHOUGH I HAD MET WITH SO MUCH AFFLICTION AND MY HEART WAS MANY TIMES READY TO BREAK YET COULD I NOT SHED ONE TEAR IN THEIR SIGHT BUT RATHER
4406-16883-0006 BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON THERE WE SATE DOWN
4406-16883-0007 THEN CAME ONE OF THEM AND GAVE ME TWO SPOONFULS OF MEAL TO COMFORT ME AND ANOTHER GAVE ME HALF A PINT OF PEAS WHICH WAS MORE WORTH THAN MANY BUSHELS AT ANOTHER TIME THEN I WENT TO SEE KING PHILIP HE BADE ME COME IN AND SIT DOWN
4406-16883-0008 AND ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD SMOKE IT A USUAL COMPLIMENT NOWADAYS AMONGST SAINTS AND SINNERS BUT THIS NO WAY SUITED ME FOR THOUGH I HAD FORMERLY USED TOBACCO YET I HAD LEFT IT EVER SINCE I WAS FIRST TAKEN
4406-16883-0009 IT SEEMS TO BE A BAIT THE DEVIL LAYS TO MAKE MEN LOSE THEIR PRECIOUS TIME
4406-16883-0010 WHEN I HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE PIPES I WAS PRESENTLY READY FOR ANOTHER SUCH A BEWITCHING THING IT IS BUT I THANK GOD HE HAS NOW GIVEN ME POWER OVER IT SURELY THERE ARE MANY WHO
4406-16883-0011 WHEREUPON THEY FELL TO BOILING OF GROUND NUTS AND PARCHING OF CORN
4406-16883-0012 DURING MY ABODE IN THIS PLACE PHILIP SPAKE TO ME TO MAKE A SHIRT FOR HIS BOY WHICH I DID FOR WHICH HE GAVE ME A SHILLING I OFFERED THE MONEY TO MY MASTER BUT HE BADE ME KEEP IT AND WITH IT I BOUGHT A PIECE OF HORSE FLESH
4406-16883-0013 AFTERWARDS HE ASKED ME TO MAKE A CAP FOR HIS BOY FOR WHICH HE INVITED ME TO DINNER I WENT AND HE GAVE ME A PANCAKE ABOUT AS BIG AS TWO FINGERS IT WAS MADE OF PARCHED WHEAT BEATEN AND FRIED IN BEAR'S GREASE
4406-16883-0014 AND BEAR TOGETHER AND INVITED MY MASTER AND MISTRESS TO DINNER BUT THE PROUD GOSSIP BECAUSE I SERVED THEM BOTH IN ONE DISH WOULD EAT NOTHING EXCEPT ONE BIT THAT HE GAVE HER UPON THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE
4406-16883-0015 HEARING THAT MY SON WAS COME TO THIS PLACE I WENT TO SEE HIM AND FOUND HIM LYING FLAT UPON THE GROUND I ASKED HIM HOW HE COULD SLEEP SO HE ANSWERED ME THAT HE WAS NOT ASLEEP BUT AT PRAYER AND LAY SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT OBSERVE WHAT HE WAS DOING
4406-16883-0016 I PRAY GOD HE MAY REMEMBER THESE THINGS NOW HE IS RETURNED IN SAFETY AT THIS PLACE THE SUN NOW GETTING HIGHER WHAT WITH THE BEAMS AND HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE SMOKE OF THE WIGWAMS I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLIND
4406-16883-0017 WHO OWNED THAT MARY THURSTON CAME RUNNING AFTER ME AND GOT IT AWAY AGAIN
4406-16883-0018 I PUT IT IN MY POCKET TO KEEP IT SAFE YET NOTWITHSTANDING SOMEBODY STOLE IT BUT PUT FIVE INDIAN CORNS IN THE ROOM OF IT WHICH CORNS WERE THE GREATEST PROVISIONS I HAD IN MY TRAVEL FOR ONE DAY
4406-16883-0019 AND SELL ME FOR POWDER FOR SO THEY HAD SOMETIMES DISCOURSED I WAS UTTERLY HOPELESS OF GETTING HOME ON FOOT THE WAY THAT I CAME I COULD HARDLY BEAR TO THINK OF THE MANY WEARY STEPS I HAD TAKEN TO COME TO THIS PLACE THE NINTH REMOVE
4406-16883-0020 BUT INSTEAD OF GOING EITHER TO ALBANY OR HOMEWARD WE MUST GO FIVE MILES UP THE RIVER AND THEN GO OVER IT HERE WE ABODE A WHILE HERE LIVED A SORRY INDIAN WHO SPOKE TO ME TO MAKE HIM A SHIRT WHEN I HAD DONE IT HE WOULD PAY ME NOTHING
4406-16883-0021 BUT HE LIVING BY THE RIVERSIDE WHERE I OFTEN WENT TO FETCH WATER I WOULD OFTEN BE PUTTING OF HIM IN MIND AND CALLING FOR MY PAY AT LAST HE TOLD ME IF I WOULD MAKE ANOTHER SHIRT FOR A PAPOOSE NOT YET BORN HE WOULD GIVE ME A KNIFE WHICH HE DID WHEN I HAD DONE IT
4406-16883-0022 AND I WAS NOT A LITTLE GLAD THAT I HAD ANYTHING THAT THEY WOULD ACCEPT OF AND BE PLEASED WITH WHEN WE WERE AT THIS PLACE MY MASTER'S MAID CAME HOME SHE HAD BEEN GONE THREE WEEKS INTO THE NARRAGANSETT COUNTRY TO FETCH CORN
4406-16883-0023 WHERE THEY HAD STORED UP SOME IN THE GROUND
4406-16883-0024 I TURNED HOMEWARD AGAIN AND MET WITH MY MASTER HE SHOWED ME THE WAY TO MY SON WHEN I CAME TO HIM I FOUND HIM NOT WELL AND WITHALL HE HAD A BOIL ON HIS SIDE WHICH MUCH TROUBLED HIM WE BEMOANED ONE ANOTHER A WHILE AS THE LORD HELPED US
4406-16883-0025 AND THEN I RETURNED AGAIN WHEN I WAS RETURNED I FOUND MYSELF AS UNSATISFIED AS I WAS BEFORE
4406-16883-0026 MY SON WAS ILL AND I COULD NOT BUT THINK OF HIS MOURNFUL LOOKS AND NO CHRISTIAN FRIEND WAS NEAR HIM TO DO ANY OFFICE OF LOVE FOR HIM EITHER FOR SOUL OR BODY AND MY POOR GIRL I KNEW NOT WHERE SHE WAS NOR WHETHER SHE WAS SICK OR WELL OR ALIVE OR DEAD
4406-16883-0027 I REPAIRED UNDER THESE THOUGHTS TO MY BIBLE MY GREAT COMFORT IN THAT TIME AND THAT SCRIPTURE CAME TO MY HAND CAST THY BURDEN UPON THE LORD AND HE SHALL SUSTAIN THEE PSALM FIFTY FIVE
4406-16883-0028 FOR FEAR THEY WOULD GET IT FROM ME AND THERE IT LAY ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT IN MY STINKING POCKET
4406-16883-0029 BUT NOW THAT WAS SAVORY TO ME THAT ONE WOULD THINK WAS ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF A BRUTE CREATURE ONE BITTER COLD DAY I COULD FIND NO ROOM TO SIT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
4406-16883-0030 AND GAVE ME SOME GROUND NUTS AND BADE ME COME AGAIN AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD BUY ME IF THEY WERE ABLE AND YET THESE WERE STRANGERS TO ME THAT I NEVER SAW BEFORE THE TENTH REMOVE
4406-16883-0031 AND PUT IT INTO MY POCKET AND NEVER LET HER SEE IT AFTERWARD THEN THEY PACKED UP THEIR THINGS TO BE GONE AND GAVE ME MY LOAD I COMPLAINED IT WAS TOO HEAVY WHEREUPON SHE GAVE ME A SLAP IN THE FACE AND BADE ME GO
4406-16883-0032 I LIFTED UP MY HEART TO GOD HOPING THE REDEMPTION WAS NOT FAR OFF AND THE RATHER BECAUSE THEIR INSOLENCY GREW WORSE AND WORSE BUT THE THOUGHTS OF MY GOING HOMEWARD FOR SO WE BENT OUR COURSE
4406-16883-0033 MUCH CHEERED MY SPIRIT AND MADE MY BURDEN SEEM LIGHT AND ALMOST NOTHING AT ALL BUT TO MY AMAZEMENT AND GREAT PERPLEXITY THE SCALE WAS SOON TURNED FOR WHEN WE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY ON A SUDDEN MY MISTRESS GIVES OUT
4406-16883-0034 AND WOULD HAVE HAD HIM GONE BACK ALSO BUT HE WOULD NOT BUT SAID HE WOULD GO ON AND COME TO US AGAIN IN THREE DAYS MY SPIRIT WAS UPON THIS I CONFESS VERY IMPATIENT AND ALMOST OUTRAGEOUS
4406-16883-0035 BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD PSALM FORTY SIX
4406-16883-0036 WHICH WERE SOME REFRESHMENT TO ME TOWARDS NIGHT I GATHERED SOME STICKS FOR MY OWN COMFORT THAT I MIGHT NOT LIE A COLD BUT WHEN WE CAME TO LIE DOWN THEY BADE ME TO GO OUT AND LIE SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THEY HAD COMPANY THEY SAID COME IN MORE THAN THEIR OWN
4406-16883-0037 I TOLD THEM I COULD NOT TELL WHERE TO GO THEY BADE ME GO LOOK I TOLD THEM IF I WENT TO ANOTHER WIGWAM THEY WOULD BE ANGRY AND SEND ME HOME AGAIN THEN ONE OF THE COMPANY DREW HIS SWORD AND TOLD ME HE WOULD RUN ME THROUGH IF I DID NOT GO PRESENTLY THEN
4406-16883-0038 WAS I FAIN TO STOOP TO THIS RUDE FELLOW AND TO GO OUT IN THE NIGHT I KNEW NOT WHITHER MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THAT FELLOW AFTERWARDS WALKING UP AND DOWN BOSTON UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF A FRIEND INDIAN AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF THE LIKE CUT
4406-16883-0039 I WENT TO ONE WIGWAM AND THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD NO ROOM THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER AND THEY SAID THE SAME AT LAST AN OLD INDIAN BADE ME TO COME TO HIM AND HIS SQUAW GAVE ME SOME GROUND NUTS
4406-16883-0040 AND A GOOD FIRE WE HAD AND THROUGH THE GOOD PROVIDENCE OF GOD I HAD A COMFORTABLE LODGING THAT NIGHT IN THE MORNING ANOTHER INDIAN BADE ME COME AT NIGHT AND HE WOULD GIVE ME SIX GROUND NUTS WHICH I DID
4406-16883-0041 WE WENT IN THE MORNING TO GATHER GROUND NUTS TO THE RIVER AND WENT BACK AGAIN THAT NIGHT I WENT WITH A GOOD LOAD AT MY BACK FOR THEY WHEN THEY WENT THOUGH BUT A LITTLE WAY WOULD CARRY ALL THEIR TRUMPERY WITH THEM I TOLD THEM THE SKIN WAS OFF MY BACK
4406-16883-0042 BUT I HAD NO OTHER COMFORTING ANSWER FROM THEM THAN THIS THAT IT WOULD BE NO MATTER IF MY HEAD WERE OFF TOO THE THIRTEENTH REMOVE INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE BAY WHICH WAS THAT I DESIRED
4406-16883-0043 WHERE WE ABODE ALMOST A FORTNIGHT HERE ONE ASKED ME TO MAKE A SHIRT FOR HER PAPOOSE FOR WHICH SHE GAVE ME A MESS OF BROTH WHICH WAS THICKENED WITH MEAL MADE OF THE BARK OF A TREE AND TO MAKE IT THE BETTER
4406-16883-0044 AND A FEW ROASTED GROUND NUTS I HAD NOT SEEN MY SON A PRETTY WHILE
4406-16883-0045 AND ASKED HIM WHEN HE SAW HIM HE ANSWERED ME THAT SUCH A TIME HIS MASTER ROASTED HIM
4406-16883-0046 AS BIG AS HIS TWO FINGERS AND THAT HE WAS VERY GOOD MEAT BUT THE LORD UPHELD MY SPIRIT UNDER THIS DISCOURAGEMENT
4406-16883-0047 THAT MAKES THE LEAST CONSCIENCE OF SPEAKING OF TRUTH IN THIS PLACE ON A COLD NIGHT AS I LAY BY THE FIRE I REMOVED A STICK THAT KEPT THE HEAT FROM ME
4406-16883-0048 YET UPON THIS AND THE LIKE OCCASIONS I HOPE IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY WITH JOB
4406-16883-0049 BUT WHEN I WAS WITHOUT AND SAW NOTHING BUT WILDERNESS AND WOODS AND A COMPANY OF BARBAROUS HEATHENS MY MIND QUICKLY RETURNED TO ME WHICH MADE ME THINK OF THAT SPOKEN CONCERNING SAMPSON WHO SAID I WILL GO OUT AND SHAKE MYSELF AS AT OTHER TIMES
4406-16883-0050 BUT HE WIST NOT THAT THE LORD WAS DEPARTED FROM HIM ABOUT THIS TIME I BEGAN TO THINK THAT ALL MY HOPES OF RESTORATION WOULD COME TO NOTHING I THOUGHT OF THE ENGLISH ARMY AND HOPED FOR THEIR COMING AND BEING TAKEN BY THEM BUT THAT FAILED
4406-16883-0051 I HOPED TO BE CARRIED TO ALBANY AS THE INDIANS HAD DISCOURSED BEFORE BUT THAT FAILED ALSO I THOUGHT OF BEING SOLD TO MY HUSBAND
4406-16883-0052 AS MY MASTER SPAKE BUT INSTEAD OF THAT MY MASTER HIMSELF WAS GONE AND I LEFT BEHIND SO THAT MY SPIRIT WAS NOW QUITE READY TO SINK I ASKED THEM TO LET ME GO OUT AND PICK UP SOME STICKS THAT I MIGHT GET ALONE AND POUR OUT MY HEART UNTO THE LORD
4406-16883-0053 THEY ALL GATHERED ABOUT THE POOR MAN ASKING HIM MANY QUESTIONS I DESIRED ALSO TO GO AND SEE HIM AND WHEN I CAME HE WAS CRYING BITTERLY SUPPOSING THEY WOULD QUICKLY KILL HIM WHEREUPON I ASKED ONE OF THEM WHETHER THEY INTENDED TO KILL HIM HE ANSWERED ME THEY WOULD NOT
4406-16883-0054 HE BEING A LITTLE CHEERED WITH THAT I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE WELFARE OF MY HUSBAND HE TOLD ME HE SAW HIM SUCH A TIME IN THE BAY AND HE WAS WELL BUT VERY MELANCHOLY BY WHICH I CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD THOUGH I SUSPECTED IT BEFORE
4406-16883-0055 THAT WHATSOEVER THE INDIANS TOLD ME RESPECTING HIM WAS VANITY AND LIES SOME OF THEM TOLD ME HE WAS DEAD AND THEY HAD KILLED HIM SOME SAID HE WAS MARRIED AGAIN AND THAT THE GOVERNOR WISHED HIM TO MARRY AND TOLD HIM HE SHOULD HAVE HIS CHOICE
4406-16883-0056 AND THAT ALL PERSUADED I WAS DEAD SO LIKE WERE THESE BARBAROUS CREATURES TO HIM WHO WAS A LIAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS I WAS SITTING ONCE IN THE WIGWAM HERE PHILIP'S MAID CAME IN WITH THE CHILD IN HER ARMS
4406-16883-0057 I TOLD HER I WOULD TEAR HER COAT THEN WITH THAT MY MISTRESS RISES UP
4406-16883-0058 WERE GOING TO THE FRENCH FOR POWDER BUT BY THE WAY THE MOHAWKS MET WITH THEM AND KILLED FOUR OF THEIR COMPANY WHICH MADE THE REST TURN BACK AGAIN FOR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE WITH HIM HAD HE BEEN SOLD TO THE FRENCH
4406-16883-0059 THAN IT PROVED TO BE IN HIS REMAINING WITH THE INDIANS I WENT TO SEE AN ENGLISH YOUTH IN THIS PLACE
4406-16883-0060 HE TOLD ME HE WAS VERY SICK OF A FLUX WITH EATING SO MUCH BLOOD THEY HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF THE WIGWAM AND WITH HIM AN INDIAN PAPOOSE ALMOST DEAD WHOSE PARENTS HAD BEEN KILLED
441-128982-0000 WHEN THE LITTLE FLEET OF SPANISH VESSELS INCLUDING THE ONE WHICH HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ AND HIS MEN WERE ON THEIR WAY TO CAMPEACHY THEY MET WITH VERY STORMY WEATHER SO THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED AND THE SHIP WHICH CONTAINED BARTHOLEMY AND HIS COMPANIONS ARRIVED FIRST AT THE PORT FOR WHICH THEY WERE BOUND
441-128982-0001 THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD BARTHOLEMY AND THE OTHERS IN CHARGE DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN IMPORTANT CAPTURE HE HAD MADE HE SUPPOSED THAT THESE PIRATES WERE ORDINARY BUCCANEERS AND IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO KEEP THEM AS HIS OWN PRIVATE PRISONERS
441-128982-0002 FOR AS THEY WERE ALL VERY ABLE BODIED MEN THEY WOULD BE EXTREMELY USEFUL ON A SHIP BUT WHEN HIS VESSEL WAS SAFELY MOORED AND IT BECAME KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT HE HAD A COMPANY OF PIRATES ON BOARD
441-128982-0003 AND WHO HAD HEARD OF HIS VARIOUS EXPLOITS HE THEREFORE WENT TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE VESSEL AND INFORMED HIM THAT HE HAD ON BOARD ONE OF THE VERY WORST PIRATES IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHOSE WICKED DEEDS WERE WELL KNOWN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WEST INDIES
441-128982-0004 AND WHO OUGHT IMMEDIATELY TO BE DELIVERED UP TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES THIS PROPOSAL HOWEVER MET WITH NO FAVOR FROM THE SPANISH CAPTAIN WHO HAD FOUND BARTHOLEMY A VERY QUIET MAN AND COULD SEE THAT HE WAS A VERY STRONG ONE
441-128982-0005 AND HE DID NOT AT ALL DESIRE TO GIVE UP SUCH A VALUABLE ADDITION TO HIS CREW BUT THE MERCHANT GREW VERY ANGRY FOR HE KNEW THAT BARTHOLEMY HAD INFLICTED GREAT INJURY ON SPANISH COMMERCE AND AS THE CAPTAIN WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM HE WENT TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN AND REPORTED THE CASE
441-128982-0006 WHEN THIS DIGNITARY HEARD THE STORY HE IMMEDIATELY SENT A PARTY OF OFFICERS TO THE SHIP AND COMMANDED THE CAPTAIN TO DELIVER THE PIRATE LEADER INTO THEIR CHARGE THE OTHER MEN WERE LEFT WHERE THEY WERE
441-128982-0007 BUT HE DID NOT LOSE HEART AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS IRONS WHICH WERE PROBABLY VERY CLUMSY AFFAIRS AT LAST CARING LITTLE HOW MUCH HE SCRATCHED AND TORE HIS SKIN
441-128982-0008 HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING RID OF HIS FETTERS AND COULD MOVE ABOUT AS FREELY AS A TIGER IN A CAGE TO GET OUT OF THIS CAGE WAS BARTHOLEMY'S FIRST OBJECT IT WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY EASY BECAUSE IN THE COURSE OF TIME SOME ONE WOULD COME INTO THE HOLD
441-128982-0009 AND THE ATHLETIC BUCCANEER THOUGHT THAT HE COULD EASILY GET THE BETTER OF WHOEVER MIGHT OPEN THE HATCH BUT THE NEXT ACT IN THIS TRULY MELODRAMATIC PERFORMANCE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL MORE DIFFICULT FOR IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THE SHIP IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR BARTHOLEMY TO SWIM TO SHORE
441-128982-0010 AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM WHICH SEEMS A STRANGE FAILING IN A HARDY SAILOR WITH SO MANY OTHER NAUTICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE ROUGH HOLD WHERE HE WAS SHUT UP OUR PIRATE PEERING ABOUT ANXIOUS AND EARNEST
441-128982-0011 HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THIS UNWIELDY CONTRIVANCE WOULD SUPPORT HIM IN THE WATER AMONG OTHER THINGS HE HAD FOUND IN HIS RUMMAGINGS ABOUT THE HOLD WAS AN OLD KNIFE AND WITH THIS IN HIS HAND HE NOW SAT WAITING FOR A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK HIS SENTINEL
441-128982-0012 THIS CAME SOON AFTER NIGHTFALL A MAN DESCENDED WITH A LANTERN TO SEE THAT THE PRISONER WAS STILL SECURE LET US HOPE THAT IT WAS NOT THE SOLDIER WHO HAD KINDLY INFORMED HIM OF HIS FATE AND AS SOON AS HE WAS FAIRLY IN THE HOLD BARTHOLEMY SPRANG UPON HIM
441-128982-0013 THERE WAS A FIERCE STRUGGLE BUT THE PIRATE WAS QUICK AND POWERFUL AND THE SENTINEL WAS SOON DEAD THEN CARRYING HIS TWO JARS BARTHOLEMY CLIMBED SWIFTLY AND NOISELESSLY UP THE SHORT LADDER
441-128982-0014 FOR A MOMENT HE SANK BELOW THE SURFACE BUT THE TWO AIR TIGHT JARS QUICKLY ROSE AND BORE HIM UP WITH THEM THERE WAS A BUSTLE ON BOARD THE SHIP THERE WAS SOME RANDOM FIRING OF MUSKETS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPLASHING WHICH THE WATCH HAD HEARD
441-128982-0015 BUT NONE OF THE BALLS STRUCK THE PIRATE OR HIS JARS AND HE SOON FLOATED OUT OF SIGHT AND HEARING KICKING OUT WITH HIS LEGS AND PADDLING AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE HELD ON TO THE JARS WITH THE OTHER HE AT LAST MANAGED TO REACH THE LAND
441-128982-0016 AND RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD INTO THE DARK WOODS BEYOND THE TOWN BARTHOLEMY WAS NOW GREATLY IN FEAR THAT WHEN HIS ESCAPE WAS DISCOVERED HE WOULD BE TRACKED BY BLOODHOUNDS
