1088-134315-0052 I KNOW HE GOES IN SOMETIMES BECAUSE I TRIED A DODGE THAT MY BROTHER WHO'S A POLICEMAN TAUGHT ME I STRETCHED A BIT OF WHITE COTTON ACROSS IT AN IT WAS BROKE THE NEXT MORNING MISTER KARA KEEPS SOME OF HIS PRIVATE PAPERS IN THERE SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY HE HAS TOLD ME SO HIMSELF
1088-134315-0053 SAID THE WOMAN DOUBTFULLY I WISH HE'D BRICK IT UP THE SAME AS HE HAS THE LOWER CELLAR I GET THE HORRORS SITTIN HERE AT NIGHT EXPECTIN THE DOOR TO OPEN AN THE GHOST OF THE MAD LORD TO COME OUT HIM THAT WAS KILLED IN AFRICA MISS HOLLAND LAUGHED I WANT YOU TO GO OUT NOW SHE SAID
1088-134315-0054 THE GIRL ASCENDED TO THE UPPER FLOOR AGAIN SHE WATCHED FROM THE WINDOW THE DISAPPEARING FIGURE ONCE OUT OF SIGHT MISS HOLLAND WENT TO WORK WITH A REMARKABLE DELIBERATION AND THOROUGHNESS FROM HER BAG SHE PRODUCED A SMALL PURSE AND OPENED IT
1088-134315-0055 IN THAT CASE WAS A NEW STEEL KEY
1088-134315-0056 IN TWO SECONDS IT WAS OPEN AND SHE WAS EXAMINING ITS CONTENTS IT WAS A LARGE SAFE OF THE USUAL TYPE THERE WERE FOUR STEEL DRAWERS FITTED AT THE BACK AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STRONG BOX
1088-134315-0057 AN EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST DRAWER DID NOT PRODUCE ALL THAT SHE HAD EXPECTED SHE RETURNED THE PAPERS TO THE DRAWER PUSHED IT TO AND LOCKED IT SHE GAVE HER ATTENTION TO THE SECOND DRAWER HER HAND SHOOK A LITTLE AS SHE PULLED IT OPEN
1088-134315-0058 IT WAS A SQUARE CASE COVERED IN RED MOROCCO LEATHER SHE INSERTED HER SHAKING HAND AND TOOK IT OUT WITH A TRIUMPHANT LITTLE CRY AT LAST SHE SAID ALOUD AND THEN A HAND GRASPED HER WRIST AND IN A PANIC SHE TURNED TO MEET THE SMILING FACE
1088-134318-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE KARA LAY BACK ON HIS DOWN PILLOWS WITH A SNEER ON HIS FACE AND HIS BRAIN VERY BUSY WHAT STARTED THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT HE DID NOT KNOW BUT AT THAT MOMENT HIS MIND WAS VERY FAR AWAY
1088-134318-0001 IT CARRIED HIM BACK A DOZEN YEARS TO A DIRTY LITTLE PEASANT'S CABIN ON THE HILLSIDE OUTSIDE DURAZZO TO THE LIVID FACE OF A YOUNG ALBANIAN CHIEF WHO HAD LOST AT KARA'S WHIM ALL THAT LIFE HELD FOR A MAN
1088-134318-0002 TO THE HATEFUL EYES OF THE GIRL'S FATHER WHO STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS GLARING DOWN AT THE BOUND AND MANACLED FIGURE ON THE FLOOR TO THE SMOKE STAINED RAFTERS OF THIS PEASANT COTTAGE AND THE DANCING SHADOWS ON THE ROOF
1088-134318-0003 TO THAT TERRIBLE HOUR OF WAITING WHEN HE SAT BOUND TO A POST WITH A CANDLE FLICKERING AND SPLUTTERING LOWER AND LOWER TO THE LITTLE HEAP OF GUNPOWDER THAT WOULD START THE TRAIL TOWARD THE CLUMSY INFERNAL MACHINE UNDER HIS CHAIR
1088-134318-0004 HE REMEMBERED THE DAY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS CANDLEMAS DAY AND THIS WAS THE ANNIVERSARY HE REMEMBERED OTHER THINGS MORE PLEASANT
1088-134318-0005 HE REMEMBERED WITH A SAVAGE JOY THE SPECTACLE OF HIS WOULD BE ASSASSINS TWITCHING AND STRUGGLING ON THE GALLOWS AT PEZARA AND
1088-134318-0006 HAD T X RETURNED HE SLIPPED FROM THE BED AND WENT TO THE DOOR OPENED IT SLIGHTLY AND LISTENED T X WITH A SEARCH WARRANT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF PANIC ESPECIALLY IF HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE HAD SATISFIED T X AND ALLAYED HIS SUSPICIONS
1088-134318-0007 KARA BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF AND HIS FACE WAS WREATHED IN SMILES WHY OF COURSE TELL HIM TO COME UP ASK HIM IF HE MINDS SEEING ME IN MY ROOM I TOLD HIM YOU WERE IN BED SIR AND HE USED SHOCKING LANGUAGE SAID FISHER KARA LAUGHED SEND HIM UP HE SAID
1088-134318-0008 YES SIR SAID THE SERVANT SUCH AN INSTRUCTION WAS REMARKABLY PLEASING TO HIM THERE WAS MUCH THAT HE HAD TO DO AND THAT NIGHT'S FREEDOM WOULD ASSIST HIM MATERIALLY PERHAPS KARA HESITATED PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER WAIT UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK
1088-134318-0009 BRING ME UP SOME SANDWICHES AND A LARGE GLASS OF MILK OR BETTER STILL PLACE THEM ON A PLATE IN THE HALL VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE MAN AND WITHDREW DOWN BELOW THAT GROTESQUE FIGURE WITH HIS SHINY HAT AND HIS RAGGED BEARD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE TESSELATED HALLWAY
1088-134318-0010 MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND STARING AT THE VARIOUS OBJECTS IN THE HALL WITH A CERTAIN AMUSED ANTAGONISM MISTER KARA WILL SEE YOU SIR SAID FISHER OH SAID THE OTHER GLARING AT THE UNOFFENDING FISHER THAT'S VERY GOOD OF HIM
1088-134318-0011 YES SIR SAID FISHER LOOK HERE THE MAN THRUST OUT HIS FACE DO YOU SEE THOSE GREY HAIRS IN MY BEARD THE EMBARRASSED FISHER GRINNED IS IT GREY CHALLENGED THE VISITOR WITH A ROAR
1088-134318-0012 YES SIR SAID THE VALET HASTILY IS IT REAL GREY INSISTED THE VISITOR PULL ONE OUT AND SEE THE STARTLED FISHER DREW BACK WITH AN APOLOGETIC SMILE I COULDN'T THINK OF DOING A THING LIKE THAT SIR OH YOU COULDN'T SNEERED THE VISITOR
1088-134318-0013 THEN LEAD ON FISHER SHOWED THE WAY UP THE STAIRS THIS TIME THE TRAVELLER CARRIED NO BOOKS HIS LEFT ARM HUNG LIMPLY BY HIS SIDE AND FISHER PRIVATELY GATHERED THAT THE HAND HAD GOT LOOSE FROM THE DETAINING POCKET WITHOUT ITS OWNER BEING AWARE OF THE FACT
1088-134318-0014 HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER GATHERCOLE AND KARA CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE TO MEET HIS AGENT WHO WITH TOP HAT STILL ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND HIS OVERCOAT DANGLING ABOUT HIS HEELS MUST HAVE MADE A REMARKABLE PICTURE
1088-134318-0015 FISHER CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND RETURNED TO HIS DUTIES IN THE HALL BELOW TEN MINUTES LATER HE HEARD THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BOOMING VOICE OF THE STRANGER CAME DOWN TO HIM FISHER WENT UP THE STAIRS TO MEET HIM AND FOUND HIM ADDRESSING THE OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM IN HIS OWN ECCENTRIC FASHION
1088-134318-0016 NO MORE PATAGONIA HE ROARED NO MORE TIERRA DEL FUEGO HE PAUSED CERTAINLY HE REPLIED TO SOME QUESTION BUT NOT PATAGONIA HE PAUSED AGAIN
1088-134318-0017 AND FISHER STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WONDERED WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE THE VISITOR SO GENIAL I SUPPOSE YOUR CHEQUE WILL BE HONOURED ALL RIGHT ASKED THE VISITOR SARDONICALLY AND THEN BURST INTO A LITTLE CHUCKLE OF LAUGHTER AS HE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR
1088-134318-0018 DAMN ALL GREEKS HE SAID JOVIALLY AND FISHER COULD DO NO MORE THAN SMILE REPROACHFULLY THE SMILE BEING HIS VERY OWN THE REPROACH BEING ON BEHALF OF THE MASTER WHO PAID HIM THE TRAVELLER TOUCHED THE OTHER ON THE CHEST WITH HIS RIGHT HAND NEVER TRUST A GREEK HE SAID
1088-134318-0019 ALWAYS GET YOUR MONEY IN ADVANCE IS THAT CLEAR TO YOU YES SIR SAID FISHER BUT I THINK YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND THAT MISTER KARA IS ALWAYS MOST GENEROUS ABOUT MONEY DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT MY POOR MAN SAID THE OTHER YOU
1088-134318-0020 AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME FROM KARA'S ROOM A FAINT CLANG WHAT'S THAT ASKED THE VISITOR A LITTLE STARTLED MISTER KARA'S PUT DOWN HIS STEEL LATCH SAID FISHER WITH A SMILE WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS NOT TO BE DISTURBED UNTIL HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
1088-134318-0021 UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT ANY RATE HE'S A FUNK SNAPPED THE OTHER A BEASTLY FUNK HE STAMPED DOWN THE STAIRS AS THOUGH TESTING THE WEIGHT OF EVERY TREAD OPENED THE FRONT DOOR WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SLAMMED IT BEHIND HIM AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT
1098-133695-0000 AS IF THE YOUNG LADY HAD BEEN IN A POSITION TO APPEAL TO IT BUT IN FACT THE BRITISH PUBLIC REMAINED FOR THE PRESENT PROFOUNDLY INDIFFERENT TO MISS ISABEL ARCHER WHOSE FORTUNE HAD DROPPED HER AS HER COUSIN SAID INTO THE DULLEST HOUSE IN ENGLAND
1098-133695-0001 HER GOUTY UNCLE RECEIVED VERY LITTLE COMPANY AND MISSUS TOUCHETT NOT HAVING CULTIVATED RELATIONS WITH HER HUSBAND'S NEIGHBOURS WAS NOT WARRANTED IN EXPECTING VISITS FROM THEM SHE HAD HOWEVER A PECULIAR TASTE SHE LIKED TO RECEIVE CARDS
1098-133695-0002 FOR WHAT IS USUALLY CALLED SOCIAL INTERCOURSE SHE HAD VERY LITTLE RELISH BUT NOTHING PLEASED HER MORE THAN TO FIND HER HALL TABLE WHITENED WITH OBLONG MORSELS OF SYMBOLIC PASTEBOARD SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS A VERY JUST WOMAN
1098-133695-0003 AND HAD MASTERED THE SOVEREIGN TRUTH THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS GOT FOR NOTHING SHE HAD PLAYED NO SOCIAL PART AS MISTRESS OF GARDENCOURT AND IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY A MINUTE ACCOUNT SHOULD BE KEPT OF HER COMINGS AND GOINGS
1098-133695-0004 BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL IT TO BE WRONG THAT SO LITTLE NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THEM AND THAT HER FAILURE REALLY VERY GRATUITOUS TO MAKE HERSELF IMPORTANT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD NOT MUCH TO DO WITH THE ACRIMONY OF HER ALLUSIONS TO HER HUSBAND'S ADOPTED COUNTRY
1098-133695-0005 ISABEL PRESENTLY FOUND HERSELF IN THE SINGULAR SITUATION OF DEFENDING THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION AGAINST HER AUNT
1098-133695-0006 ISABEL ALWAYS FELT AN IMPULSE TO PULL OUT THE PINS NOT THAT SHE IMAGINED THEY INFLICTED ANY DAMAGE ON THE TOUGH OLD PARCHMENT BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HER HER AUNT MIGHT MAKE BETTER USE OF HER SHARPNESS
1098-133695-0007 SHE WAS VERY CRITICAL HERSELF IT WAS INCIDENTAL TO HER AGE HER SEX AND HER NATIONALITY BUT SHE WAS VERY SENTIMENTAL AS WELL AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DRYNESS THAT SET HER OWN MORAL FOUNTAINS FLOWING NOW WHAT'S YOUR POINT OF VIEW
1098-133695-0008 SHE ASKED OF HER AUNT WHEN YOU CRITICISE EVERYTHING HERE YOU SHOULD HAVE A POINT OF VIEW YOURS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AMERICAN YOU THOUGHT EVERYTHING OVER THERE SO DISAGREEABLE WHEN I CRITICISE I HAVE MINE IT'S THOROUGHLY AMERICAN
1098-133695-0009 THERE ARE AS MANY POINTS OF VIEW IN THE WORLD AS THERE ARE PEOPLE OF SENSE TO TAKE THEM YOU MAY SAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM VERY NUMEROUS AMERICAN NEVER IN THE WORLD THAT'S SHOCKINGLY NARROW MY POINT OF VIEW THANK GOD IS PERSONAL
1098-133695-0010 ISABEL THOUGHT THIS A BETTER ANSWER THAN SHE ADMITTED IT WAS A TOLERABLE DESCRIPTION OF HER OWN MANNER OF JUDGING BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE SOUNDED WELL FOR HER TO SAY SO
1098-133695-0011 WOULD SAVOUR OF IMMODESTY EVEN OF ARROGANCE
1098-133695-0012 WITH WHOM SHE TALKED A GREAT DEAL AND WITH WHOM HER CONVERSATION WAS OF A SORT THAT GAVE A LARGE LICENCE TO EXTRAVAGANCE HER COUSIN USED AS THE PHRASE IS TO CHAFF HER
1098-133695-0013 HE VERY SOON ESTABLISHED WITH HER A REPUTATION FOR TREATING EVERYTHING AS A JOKE AND HE WAS NOT A MAN TO NEGLECT THE PRIVILEGES SUCH A REPUTATION CONFERRED
1098-133695-0014 OF LAUGHING AT ALL THINGS BEGINNING WITH HIMSELF SUCH SLENDER FACULTY OF REVERENCE AS HE POSSESSED CENTRED WHOLLY UPON HIS FATHER FOR THE REST HE EXERCISED HIS WIT INDIFFERENTLY UPON HIS FATHER'S SON THIS GENTLEMAN'S WEAK LUNGS
1098-133695-0015 HIS USELESS LIFE HIS FANTASTIC MOTHER
1098-133695-0016 HIS ADOPTED AND HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HIS CHARMING NEW FOUND COUSIN I KEEP A BAND OF MUSIC IN MY ANTE ROOM HE SAID ONCE TO HER IT HAS ORDERS TO PLAY WITHOUT STOPPING IT RENDERS ME TWO EXCELLENT SERVICES
1098-133695-0017 IT KEEPS THE SOUNDS OF THE WORLD FROM REACHING THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS AND IT MAKES THE WORLD THINK THAT DANCING'S GOING ON WITHIN
1098-133695-0018 THE LIVELIEST WALTZES SEEMED TO FLOAT UPON THE AIR ISABEL OFTEN FOUND HERSELF IRRITATED BY THIS PERPETUAL FIDDLING
1098-133695-0019 AND ENTER THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS IT MATTERED LITTLE THAT HE HAD ASSURED HER THEY WERE A VERY DISMAL PLACE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO UNDERTAKE TO SWEEP THEM AND SET THEM IN ORDER IT WAS BUT HALF HOSPITALITY TO LET HER REMAIN OUTSIDE
1098-133695-0020 IT MUST BE SAID THAT HER WIT WAS EXERCISED TO A LARGE EXTENT IN SELF DEFENCE FOR HER COUSIN AMUSED HIMSELF WITH CALLING HER COLUMBIA AND ACCUSING HER OF A PATRIOTISM SO HEATED THAT IT SCORCHED HE DREW A CARICATURE OF HER
1098-133695-0021 IN THE FOLDS OF THE NATIONAL BANNER ISABEL'S CHIEF DREAD IN LIFE AT THIS PERIOD OF HER DEVELOPMENT WAS THAT SHE SHOULD APPEAR NARROW MINDED WHAT SHE FEARED NEXT AFTERWARDS WAS THAT SHE SHOULD REALLY BE SO BUT SHE NEVERTHELESS
1098-133695-0022 SHE WOULD BE AS AMERICAN AS IT PLEASED HIM TO REGARD HER AND IF HE CHOSE TO LAUGH AT HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM PLENTY OF OCCUPATION SHE DEFENDED ENGLAND AGAINST HIS MOTHER BUT WHEN RALPH SANG ITS PRAISES ON PURPOSE AS SHE SAID TO WORK HER UP
1098-133695-0023 SHE FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO DIFFER FROM HIM ON A VARIETY OF POINTS IN FACT THE QUALITY OF THIS SMALL RIPE COUNTRY SEEMED AS SWEET TO HER AS THE TASTE OF AN OCTOBER PEAR
1098-133695-0024 AND HER SATISFACTION WAS AT THE ROOT OF THE GOOD SPIRITS WHICH ENABLED HER TO TAKE HER COUSIN'S CHAFF
1098-133695-0025 IF HER GOOD HUMOUR FLAGGED AT MOMENTS IT WAS NOT BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT HERSELF ILL USED BUT BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY FELT SORRY FOR RALPH IT SEEMED TO HER HE WAS TALKING AS A BLIND AND HAD LITTLE HEART IN WHAT HE SAID
1098-133695-0026 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU SHE OBSERVED TO HIM ONCE BUT I SUSPECT YOU'RE A GREAT HUMBUG THAT'S YOUR PRIVILEGE RALPH ANSWERED WHO HAD NOT BEEN USED TO BEING SO CRUDELY ADDRESSED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CARE FOR
1098-133695-0027 I DON'T THINK YOU CARE FOR ANYTHING YOU DON'T REALLY CARE FOR ENGLAND WHEN YOU PRAISE IT YOU DON'T CARE FOR AMERICA EVEN WHEN YOU PRETEND TO ABUSE IT I CARE FOR NOTHING BUT YOU DEAR COUSIN SAID RALPH IF I COULD BELIEVE
1098-133695-0028 EVEN THAT I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD AH WELL I SHOULD HOPE SO THE YOUNG MAN EXCLAIMED ISABEL MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED IT AND NOT HAVE BEEN FAR FROM THE TRUTH HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PRESENT TO HIS MIND
1098-133695-0029 AT A TIME WHEN HIS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF A BURDEN TO HIM HER SUDDEN ARRIVAL WHICH PROMISED NOTHING AND WAS AN OPEN HANDED GIFT OF FATE HAD REFRESHED AND QUICKENED THEM GIVEN THEM WINGS AND SOMETHING TO FLY FOR
1098-133695-0030 POOR RALPH HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS STEEPED IN MELANCHOLY HIS OUTLOOK HABITUALLY SOMBRE LAY UNDER THE SHADOW OF A DEEPER CLOUD
1098-133695-0031 THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN GRAVELY ILL IN THE SPRING AND THE DOCTORS HAD WHISPERED TO RALPH THAT ANOTHER ATTACK WOULD BE LESS EASY TO DEAL WITH JUST NOW HE APPEARED DISBURDENED OF PAIN BUT RALPH COULD NOT RID HIMSELF OF A SUSPICION THAT THIS WAS A SUBTERFUGE OF THE ENEMY
1098-133695-0032 WHO WAS WAITING TO TAKE HIM OFF HIS GUARD IF THE MANOEUVRE SHOULD SUCCEED THERE WOULD BE LITTLE HOPE OF ANY GREAT RESISTANCE RALPH HAD ALWAYS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT HIS FATHER WOULD SURVIVE HIM THAT HIS OWN NAME WOULD BE THE FIRST GRIMLY CALLED
1098-133695-0033 THE FATHER AND SON HAD BEEN CLOSE COMPANIONS AND THE IDEA OF BEING LEFT ALONE WITH THE REMNANT OF A TASTELESS LIFE ON HIS HANDS WAS NOT GRATIFYING TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ALWAYS AND TACITLY COUNTED UPON HIS ELDER'S HELP IN MAKING THE BEST OF A POOR BUSINESS
1098-133695-0034 AT THE PROSPECT OF LOSING HIS GREAT MOTIVE RALPH LOST INDEED HIS ONE INSPIRATION
1098-133695-0035 BUT WITHOUT THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS FATHER'S SOCIETY HE SHOULD BARELY HAVE PATIENCE TO AWAIT HIS OWN TURN HE HAD NOT THE INCENTIVE OF FEELING THAT HE WAS INDISPENSABLE TO HIS MOTHER IT WAS A RULE WITH HIS MOTHER TO HAVE NO REGRETS
1098-133695-0036 HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF COURSE THAT IT HAD BEEN A SMALL KINDNESS TO HIS FATHER TO WISH THAT OF THE TWO THE ACTIVE RATHER THAN THE PASSIVE PARTY SHOULD KNOW THE FELT WOUND HE REMEMBERED THAT THE OLD MAN HAD ALWAYS TREATED HIS OWN FORECAST OF AN EARLY END AS A CLEVER FALLACY
1098-133695-0037 WHICH HE SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO DISCREDIT SO FAR AS HE MIGHT BY DYING FIRST BUT OF THE TWO TRIUMPHS THAT OF REFUTING A SOPHISTICAL SON AND THAT OF HOLDING ON A WHILE LONGER TO A STATE OF BEING WHICH WITH ALL ABATEMENTS HE ENJOYED
1098-133695-0038 HE WONDERED WHETHER HE WERE HARBOURING LOVE FOR THIS SPONTANEOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY BUT HE JUDGED THAT ON THE WHOLE HE WAS NOT AFTER HE HAD KNOWN HER FOR A WEEK HE QUITE MADE UP HIS MIND TO THIS AND EVERY DAY HE FELT A LITTLE MORE SURE
1098-133695-0039 LORD WARBURTON HAD BEEN RIGHT ABOUT HER SHE WAS A REALLY INTERESTING LITTLE FIGURE RALPH WONDERED HOW THEIR NEIGHBOUR HAD FOUND IT OUT SO SOON AND THEN HE SAID IT WAS ONLY ANOTHER PROOF OF HIS FRIEND'S HIGH ABILITIES
1098-133695-0040 WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS GREATLY ADMIRED IF HIS COUSIN WERE TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN AN ENTERTAINMENT TO HIM RALPH WAS CONSCIOUS SHE WAS AN ENTERTAINMENT OF A HIGH ORDER A CHARACTER LIKE THAT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
1098-133695-0041 A REAL LITTLE PASSIONATE FORCE TO SEE AT PLAY IS THE FINEST THING IN NATURE IT'S FINER THAN THE FINEST WORK OF ART THAN A GREEK BAS RELIEF
1098-133695-0042 THAN A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL IT'S VERY PLEASANT TO BE SO WELL TREATED WHERE ONE HAD LEAST LOOKED FOR IT I HAD NEVER BEEN MORE BLUE MORE BORED THAN FOR A WEEK BEFORE SHE CAME I HAD NEVER EXPECTED LESS THAT ANYTHING PLEASANT WOULD HAPPEN
1098-133695-0043 A GREEK BAS RELIEF TO STICK OVER MY CHIMNEY PIECE THE KEY OF A BEAUTIFUL EDIFICE IS THRUST INTO MY HAND AND I'M TOLD TO WALK IN AND ADMIRE MY POOR BOY YOU'VE BEEN SADLY UNGRATEFUL
1098-133695-0044 AND NOW YOU HAD BETTER KEEP VERY QUIET AND NEVER GRUMBLE AGAIN THE SENTIMENT OF THESE REFLEXIONS WAS VERY JUST
1098-133695-0045 HIS COUSIN WAS A VERY BRILLIANT GIRL
1098-133695-0046 BUT SHE NEEDED THE KNOWING AND HIS ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO HER THOUGH IT WAS CONTEMPLATIVE AND CRITICAL WAS NOT JUDICIAL HE SURVEYED THE EDIFICE FROM THE OUTSIDE AND ADMIRED IT GREATLY
1098-133695-0047 ISABEL'S ORIGINALITY WAS THAT SHE GAVE ONE AN IMPRESSION OF HAVING INTENTIONS OF HER OWN WHENEVER SHE EXECUTES THEM SAID RALPH MAY I BE THERE TO SEE IT DEVOLVED UPON HIM OF COURSE TO DO THE HONOURS OF THE PLACE
1098-133695-0048 AND HIS WIFE'S POSITION WAS THAT OF RATHER A GRIM VISITOR SO THAT IN THE LINE OF CONDUCT THAT OPENED ITSELF TO RALPH DUTY AND INCLINATION WERE HARMONIOUSLY MIXED HE WAS NOT A GREAT WALKER BUT HE STROLLED ABOUT THE GROUNDS WITH HIS COUSIN
1098-133695-0049 A PASTIME FOR WHICH THE WEATHER REMAINED FAVOURABLE WITH A PERSISTENCY NOT ALLOWED FOR IN ISABEL'S SOMEWHAT LUGUBRIOUS PREVISION OF THE CLIMATE AND IN THE LONG AFTERNOONS OF WHICH THE LENGTH WAS BUT THE MEASURE OF HER GRATIFIED EAGERNESS
1098-133695-0050 THEY TOOK A BOAT ON THE RIVER THE DEAR LITTLE RIVER AS ISABEL CALLED IT WHERE THE OPPOSITE SHORE SEEMED STILL A PART OF THE FOREGROUND OF THE LANDSCAPE OR DROVE OVER THE COUNTRY IN A PHAETON A LOW CAPACIOUS THICK WHEELED PHAETON
1098-133695-0051 BUT WHICH HE HAD NOW CEASED TO ENJOY ISABEL ENJOYED IT LARGELY AND HANDLING THE REINS IN A MANNER WHICH APPROVED ITSELF TO THE GROOM AS KNOWING WAS NEVER WEARY OF DRIVING HER UNCLE'S CAPITAL HORSES THROUGH WINDING LANES AND BYWAYS
1098-133695-0052 FULL OF THE RURAL INCIDENTS SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND PAST COTTAGES THATCHED AND TIMBERED PAST ALE HOUSES LATTICED AND SANDED PAST PATCHES OF ANCIENT COMMON AND GLIMPSES OF EMPTY PARKS
1098-133695-0053 BETWEEN HEDGEROWS MADE THICK BY MIDSUMMER WHEN THEY REACHED HOME THEY USUALLY FOUND TEA HAD BEEN SERVED ON THE LAWN
1098-133695-0054 BUT THE TWO FOR THE MOST PART SAT SILENT THE OLD MAN WITH HIS HEAD BACK AND HIS EYES CLOSED HIS WIFE OCCUPIED WITH HER KNITTING AND WEARING THAT APPEARANCE OF RARE PROFUNDITY WITH WHICH SOME LADIES CONSIDER THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR NEEDLES
1098-133695-0055 ONE DAY HOWEVER A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED THE TWO YOUNG PERSONS AFTER SPENDING AN HOUR ON THE RIVER STROLLED BACK TO THE HOUSE AND PERCEIVED LORD WARBURTON SITTING UNDER THE TREES AND ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION
1098-133695-0056 OF WHICH EVEN AT A DISTANCE THE DESULTORY CHARACTER WAS APPRECIABLE WITH
1098-133695-0057 HE HAD DRIVEN OVER FROM HIS OWN PLACE WITH A PORTMANTEAU AND HAD ASKED AS THE FATHER AND SON OFTEN INVITED HIM TO DO FOR A DINNER AND A LODGING ISABEL SEEING HIM FOR HALF AN HOUR ON THE DAY OF HER ARRIVAL HAD DISCOVERED IN THIS BRIEF SPACE THAT SHE LIKED HIM
1098-133695-0058 HE HAD INDEED RATHER SHARPLY REGISTERED HIMSELF ON HER FINE SENSE AND SHE HAD THOUGHT OF HIM SEVERAL TIMES SHE HAD HOPED SHE SHOULD SEE HIM AGAIN HOPED TOO THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A FEW OTHERS GARDENCOURT WAS NOT DULL
1098-133695-0059 THE PLACE ITSELF WAS SOVEREIGN HER UNCLE WAS MORE AND MORE A SORT OF GOLDEN GRANDFATHER AND RALPH WAS UNLIKE ANY COUSIN SHE HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED HER IDEA OF COUSINS HAVING TENDED TO GLOOM THEN
1098-133695-0060 HER IMPRESSIONS WERE STILL SO FRESH AND SO QUICKLY RENEWED THAT THERE WAS AS YET HARDLY A HINT OF VACANCY IN THE VIEW BUT ISABEL HAD NEED TO REMIND HERSELF THAT SHE WAS INTERESTED IN HUMAN NATURE AND THAT HER FOREMOST HOPE IN COMING ABROAD
1098-133695-0061 HAD BEEN THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHEN RALPH SAID TO HER AS HE HAD DONE SEVERAL TIMES I WONDER YOU FIND THIS ENDURABLE YOU OUGHT TO SEE SOME OF THE NEIGHBOURS AND SOME OF OUR FRIENDS
1098-133695-0062 THOUGH YOU WOULD NEVER SUPPOSE IT WHEN HE OFFERED TO INVITE WHAT HE CALLED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND MAKE HER ACQUAINTED WITH ENGLISH SOCIETY SHE ENCOURAGED THE HOSPITABLE IMPULSE AND PROMISED IN ADVANCE TO HURL HERSELF INTO THE FRAY
1098-133695-0063 LITTLE HOWEVER FOR THE PRESENT HAD COME OF HIS OFFERS AND IT MAY BE CONFIDED TO THE READER THAT IF THE YOUNG MAN DELAYED TO CARRY THEM OUT IT WAS BECAUSE HE FOUND THE LABOUR OF PROVIDING FOR HIS COMPANION BY NO MEANS SO SEVERE AS TO REQUIRE EXTRANEOUS HELP
1098-133695-0064 ISABEL HAD SPOKEN TO HIM VERY OFTEN ABOUT SPECIMENS IT WAS A WORD THAT PLAYED A CONSIDERABLE PART IN HER VOCABULARY SHE HAD GIVEN HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WISHED TO SEE ENGLISH SOCIETY ILLUSTRATED BY EMINENT CASES
1098-133695-0065 WELL NOW THERE'S A SPECIMEN HE SAID TO HER AS THEY WALKED UP FROM THE RIVERSIDE AND HE RECOGNISED LORD WARBURTON A SPECIMEN OF WHAT ASKED THE GIRL A SPECIMEN OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN DO YOU MEAN THEY'RE ALL LIKE HIM
1098-133695-0066 OH NO THEY'RE NOT ALL LIKE HIM
1098-133695-0067 SAID ISABEL BECAUSE I'M SURE HE'S NICE
1098-133695-0068 THE FORTUNATE LORD WARBURTON EXCHANGED A HANDSHAKE WITH OUR HEROINE AND HOPED SHE WAS VERY WELL BUT I NEEDN'T ASK THAT HE SAID SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HANDLING THE OARS I'VE BEEN ROWING A LITTLE ISABEL ANSWERED BUT HOW SHOULD YOU KNOW IT
1098-133695-0069 OH I KNOW HE DOESN'T ROW HE'S TOO LAZY SAID HIS LORDSHIP INDICATING RALPH TOUCHETT WITH A LAUGH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR HIS LAZINESS ISABEL REJOINED LOWERING HER VOICE A LITTLE AH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING
1098-133695-0070 CRIED LORD WARBURTON STILL WITH HIS SONOROUS MIRTH MY EXCUSE FOR NOT ROWING IS THAT MY COUSIN ROWS SO WELL SAID RALPH SHE DOES EVERYTHING WELL SHE TOUCHES NOTHING THAT SHE DOESN'T ADORN
