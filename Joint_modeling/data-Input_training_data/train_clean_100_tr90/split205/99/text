3983-5371-0039 AND WITH THAT HE BURST OUT CRYING AND GAVE BILL WHITE HALF A CROWN OUT OF HIS POCKET
3983-5371-0040 AFY SAW IT IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME MENTIONING HER NAME TO YOU MA'AM

3983-5371-0042 JOYCE WAS SILENT TO CONTRADICT MISS CORNY BROUGHT TRIUMPH TO NOBODY AND SHE WAS CONSCIOUS IN HER INNERMOST HEART THAT AFY MERITED A LITTLE WHOLESOME CORRECTION NOT PERHAPS TO THE EXTENT OF A DUCKING
3983-5371-0043 MA'AM REPEATED JOYCE IN SOME SURPRISE AS IT APPEARED THE GOVERNESS DO YOU MEAN MADAME VINE DO I MEAN YOU OR DO I MEAN ME ARE WE GOVERNESSES IRASCIBLY CRIED MISS CORNY WHO SHOULD I MEAN BUT MADAME VINE
3983-5371-0044 SHE TURNED HERSELF ROUND FROM THE LOOKING GLASS AND GAZED FULL IN JOYCE'S FACE WAITING FOR THE ANSWER JOYCE LOWERED HER VOICE AS SHE GAVE IT
3983-5371-0045 AND I CAN TELL YOU JOYCE THAT I WAS CONFOUNDED AT THE LIKENESS IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY LIKENESS
3983-5371-0046 THAT EVENING AFTER DINNER MISS CARLYLE AND LORD MOUNT SEVERN SAT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE SAME SOFA COFFEE CUPS IN HAND MISS CARLYLE TURNED TO THE EARL WAS IT A POSITIVELY ASCERTAINED FACT THAT LADY ISABEL DIED THE EARL STARED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
3983-5371-0047 HE THOUGHT IT THE STRANGEST QUESTION THAT EVER WAS ASKED HIM I SCARCELY UNDERSTAND YOU MISS CARLYLE DIED CERTAINLY SHE DIED WHEN THE RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT WAS COMMUNICATED TO YOU YOU MADE INQUIRY YOURSELF INTO ITS TRUTH ITS DETAILS I BELIEVE
3983-5371-0048 IT WAS MY DUTY TO DO SO THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO UNDERTAKE IT DID YOU ASCERTAIN POSITIVELY BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT SHE DID DIE
3983-5371-0049 A PAUSE MISS CARLYLE WAS RUMINATING BUT SHE RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AS IF DIFFICULT TO BE CONVINCED YOU DEEM THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBILITY OF AN ERROR YOU ARE SURE THAT SHE IS DEAD
3983-5371-0050 I AM AS SURE THAT SHE IS DEAD AS THAT WE ARE LIVING DECISIVELY REPLIED THE EARL AND HE SPOKE BUT ACCORDING TO HIS BELIEF WHEREFORE SHOULD YOU BE INQUIRING THIS A THOUGHT CAME OVER ME ONLY TO DAY TO WONDER WHETHER SHE WAS REALLY DEAD
3983-5371-0051 HAD ANY ERROR OCCURRED AT THAT TIME ANY FALSE REPORT OF HER DEATH I SHOULD SOON HAVE FOUND IT OUT BY HER DRAWING THE ANNUITY I SETTLED UPON HER IT HAS NEVER BEEN DRAWN SINCE BESIDES SHE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN TO ME AS AGREED UPON
3983-5371-0052 NO POOR THING SHE IS GONE BEYOND ALL DOUBT AND HAS TAKEN HER SINS WITH HER CONVINCING PROOFS AND MISS CARLYLE LENT HER EAR TO THEM THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHILE MADAME VINE WAS AT BREAKFAST MISTER CARLYLE ENTERED

3983-5371-0056 YOU CAN REMIND DOCTOR MARTIN THAT THE CHILD'S CONSTITUTION IS PRECISELY WHAT HIS MOTHER'S WAS CONTINUED MISTER CARLYLE A TINGE LIGHTENING HIS FACE IT MAY BE A GUIDE TO HIS TREATMENT HE SAID HIMSELF IT WAS WHEN HE ATTENDED HIM FOR AN ILLNESS A YEAR OR TWO AGO
3983-5371-0057 YES SIR HE CROSSED THE HALL ON HIS ENTRANCE TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM SHE TORE UPSTAIRS TO HER CHAMBER AND SANK DOWN IN AN AGONY OF TEARS AND DESPAIR OH TO LOVE HIM AS SHE DID NOW TO YEARN AFTER HIS AFFECTION WITH THIS PASSIONATE JEALOUS LONGING
3983-5371-0058 AND TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOR EVER AND EVER THAT SHE WAS WORSE TO HIM THAN NOTHING
40-121026-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ABBE'S CHAMBER AFTER HAVING PASSED WITH TOLERABLE EASE THROUGH THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE WHICH HOWEVER DID NOT ADMIT OF THEIR HOLDING THEMSELVES ERECT THE TWO FRIENDS REACHED THE FURTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR
40-121026-0001 INTO WHICH THE ABBE'S CELL OPENED FROM THAT POINT THE PASSAGE BECAME MUCH NARROWER AND BARELY PERMITTED ONE TO CREEP THROUGH ON HANDS AND KNEES THE FLOOR OF THE ABBE'S CELL WAS PAVED AND IT HAD BEEN BY RAISING ONE OF THE STONES IN THE MOST OBSCURE CORNER
40-121026-0002 OF WHICH DANTES HAD WITNESSED THE COMPLETION AS HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER OF HIS FRIEND DANTES CAST AROUND ONE EAGER AND SEARCHING GLANCE IN QUEST OF THE EXPECTED MARVELS BUT NOTHING MORE THAN COMMON MET HIS VIEW IT IS WELL
40-121026-0003 SAID THE ABBE WE HAVE SOME HOURS BEFORE US IT IS NOW JUST A QUARTER PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK INSTINCTIVELY DANTES TURNED ROUND TO OBSERVE BY WHAT WATCH OR CLOCK THE ABBE HAD BEEN ABLE SO ACCURATELY TO SPECIFY THE HOUR
40-121026-0004 LOOK AT THIS RAY OF LIGHT WHICH ENTERS BY MY WINDOW SAID THE ABBE AND THEN OBSERVE THE LINES TRACED ON THE WALL WELL BY MEANS OF THESE LINES WHICH ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOUBLE MOTION OF THE EARTH AND THE ELLIPSE IT DESCRIBES ROUND THE SUN
40-121026-0005 THAN IF I POSSESSED A WATCH FOR THAT MIGHT BE BROKEN OR DERANGED IN ITS MOVEMENTS WHILE THE SUN AND EARTH NEVER VARY IN THEIR APPOINTED PATHS THIS LAST EXPLANATION WAS WHOLLY LOST UPON DANTES WHO HAD ALWAYS IMAGINED
40-121026-0006 APPEARED TO HIM PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE EACH WORD THAT FELL FROM HIS COMPANION'S LIPS SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH THE MYSTERIES OF SCIENCE AS WORTHY OF DIGGING OUT AS THE GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE MINES OF GUZERAT AND GOLCONDA
40-121026-0007 WHICH HE COULD JUST RECOLLECT HAVING VISITED DURING A VOYAGE MADE IN HIS EARLIEST YOUTH
40-121026-0008 I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE YOUR TREASURES THE ABBE SMILED AND PROCEEDING TO THE DISUSED FIREPLACE RAISED BY THE HELP OF HIS CHISEL A LONG STONE WHICH HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN THE HEARTH BENEATH WHICH WAS A CAVITY OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH
40-121026-0009 SERVING AS A SAFE DEPOSITORY OF THE ARTICLES MENTIONED TO DANTES
40-121026-0010 ASKED THE ABBE OH YOUR GREAT WORK ON THE MONARCHY OF ITALY
40-121026-0011 LAID ONE OVER THE OTHER LIKE FOLDS OF PAPYRUS THESE ROLLS CONSISTED OF SLIPS OF CLOTH ABOUT FOUR INCHES WIDE AND EIGHTEEN LONG THEY WERE ALL CAREFULLY NUMBERED AND CLOSELY COVERED WITH WRITING SO LEGIBLE THAT DANTES COULD EASILY READ IT
40-121026-0012 AS WELL AS MAKE OUT THE SENSE IT BEING IN ITALIAN
40-121026-0013 I WROTE THE WORD FINIS AT THE END OF THE SIXTY EIGHTH STRIP ABOUT A WEEK AGO I HAVE TORN UP TWO OF MY SHIRTS AND AS MANY HANDKERCHIEFS AS I WAS MASTER OF TO COMPLETE THE PRECIOUS PAGES
40-121026-0014 SHOULD I EVER GET OUT OF PRISON AND FIND IN ALL ITALY A PRINTER COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO PUBLISH WHAT I HAVE COMPOSED MY LITERARY REPUTATION IS FOREVER SECURED I SEE ANSWERED DANTES
40-121026-0015 NOW LET ME BEHOLD THE CURIOUS PENS WITH WHICH YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOUR WORK LOOK
40-121026-0016 SHOWING TO THE YOUNG MAN A SLENDER STICK ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG AND MUCH RESEMBLING THE SIZE OF THE HANDLE OF A FINE PAINTING BRUSH TO THE END OF WHICH WAS TIED BY A PIECE OF THREAD
40-121026-0017 AND DIVIDED AT THE NIB LIKE AN ORDINARY PEN DANTES EXAMINED IT WITH INTENSE ADMIRATION THEN LOOKED AROUND TO SEE THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN SHAPED SO CORRECTLY INTO FORM AH YES SAID FARIA THE PENKNIFE
40-121026-0018 ONE COULD CUT AND THRUST DANTES EXAMINED THE VARIOUS ARTICLES SHOWN TO HIM WITH THE SAME ATTENTION THAT HE HAD BESTOWED ON THE CURIOSITIES AND STRANGE TOOLS EXHIBITED IN THE SHOPS AT MARSEILLES
40-121026-0019 AS THE WORKS OF THE SAVAGES IN THE SOUTH SEAS FROM WHENCE THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY THE DIFFERENT TRADING VESSELS AS FOR THE INK
40-121026-0020 I TOLD YOU HOW I MANAGED TO OBTAIN THAT AND I ONLY JUST MAKE IT FROM TIME TO TIME AS I REQUIRE IT ONE THING STILL PUZZLES ME OBSERVED DANTES AND THAT IS HOW YOU MANAGED TO DO ALL THIS BY DAYLIGHT
40-121026-0021 NIGHT WHY FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE ARE YOUR EYES LIKE CATS THAT YOU CAN SEE TO WORK IN THE DARK INDEED THEY ARE NOT BUT GOD HAS SUPPLIED MAN WITH THE INTELLIGENCE THAT ENABLES HIM TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF NATURAL CONDITIONS
40-121026-0022 I FURNISHED MYSELF WITH A LIGHT
40-121026-0023 I SEPARATED THE FAT FROM THE MEAT SERVED TO ME MELTED IT AND SO MADE OIL HERE IS MY LAMP SO SAYING THE ABBE EXHIBITED A SORT OF TORCH VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN PUBLIC ILLUMINATIONS
40-121026-0024 AND MATCHES I PRETENDED THAT I HAD A DISORDER OF THE SKIN AND ASKED FOR A LITTLE SULPHUR WHICH WAS READILY SUPPLIED DANTES LAID THE DIFFERENT THINGS HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT ON THE TABLE AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAD DROOPING ON HIS BREAST
40-121026-0025 AS THOUGH OVERWHELMED BY THE PERSEVERANCE AND STRENGTH OF FARIA'S MIND YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ALL YET CONTINUED FARIA FOR I DID NOT THINK IT WISE TO TRUST ALL MY TREASURES IN THE SAME HIDING PLACE LET US SHUT THIS ONE UP
40-121026-0026 THEY PUT THE STONE BACK IN ITS PLACE THE ABBE SPRINKLED A LITTLE DUST OVER IT TO CONCEAL THE TRACES OF ITS HAVING BEEN REMOVED RUBBED HIS FOOT WELL ON IT TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE SAME APPEARANCE AS THE OTHER AND THEN GOING TOWARDS HIS BED
40-121026-0027 WHO SUPPLIED YOU WITH THE MATERIALS FOR MAKING THIS WONDERFUL WORK I TORE UP SEVERAL OF MY SHIRTS AND RIPPED OUT THE SEAMS IN THE SHEETS OF MY BED DURING MY THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT AT FENESTRELLE
40-121026-0028 SO THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINISH MY WORK HERE AND WAS IT NOT DISCOVERED THAT YOUR SHEETS WERE UNHEMMED
40-121026-0029 I HEMMED THE EDGES OVER AGAIN WITH WHAT WITH THIS NEEDLE SAID THE ABBE AS OPENING HIS RAGGED VESTMENTS HE SHOWED DANTES A LONG SHARP FISH BONE WITH A SMALL PERFORATED EYE FOR THE THREAD A SMALL PORTION OF WHICH STILL REMAINED IN IT
40-121026-0030 I ONCE THOUGHT CONTINUED FARIA OF REMOVING THESE IRON BARS AND LETTING MYSELF DOWN FROM THE WINDOW WHICH AS YOU SEE IS SOMEWHAT WIDER THAN YOURS ALTHOUGH I SHOULD HAVE ENLARGED IT STILL MORE PREPARATORY TO MY FLIGHT
40-121026-0031 HOWEVER I DISCOVERED THAT I SHOULD MERELY HAVE DROPPED INTO A SORT OF INNER COURT AND I THEREFORE RENOUNCED THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER AS TOO FULL OF RISK AND DANGER NEVERTHELESS I CAREFULLY PRESERVED MY LADDER
40-121026-0032 AND WHICH SUDDEN CHANCE FREQUENTLY BRINGS ABOUT WHILE AFFECTING TO BE DEEPLY ENGAGED IN EXAMINING THE LADDER THE MIND OF DANTES WAS IN FACT BUSILY OCCUPIED BY THE IDEA
40-121026-0033 THAT A PERSON SO INTELLIGENT INGENIOUS AND CLEAR SIGHTED AS THE ABBE MIGHT PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE DARK MYSTERY OF HIS OWN MISFORTUNES WHERE HE HIMSELF COULD SEE NOTHING
40-121026-0034 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF ASKED THE ABBE SMILINGLY IMPUTING THE DEEP ABSTRACTION IN WHICH HIS VISITOR WAS PLUNGED TO THE EXCESS OF HIS AWE AND WONDER I WAS REFLECTING IN THE FIRST PLACE REPLIED DANTES
40-121026-0035 UPON THE ENORMOUS DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ABILITY YOU MUST HAVE EMPLOYED TO REACH THE HIGH PERFECTION TO WHICH YOU HAVE ATTAINED WHAT WOULD YOU NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IF YOU HAD BEEN FREE POSSIBLY NOTHING AT ALL THE OVERFLOW OF MY BRAIN WOULD PROBABLY
40-121026-0036 IN A STATE OF FREEDOM HAVE EVAPORATED IN A THOUSAND FOLLIES MISFORTUNE IS NEEDED TO BRING TO LIGHT THE TREASURES OF THE HUMAN INTELLECT COMPRESSION IS NEEDED TO EXPLODE GUNPOWDER CAPTIVITY HAS BROUGHT MY MENTAL FACULTIES TO A FOCUS
40-121026-0037 AND YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT FROM THE COLLISION OF CLOUDS ELECTRICITY IS PRODUCED FROM ELECTRICITY LIGHTNING FROM LIGHTNING ILLUMINATION NO REPLIED DANTES I KNOW NOTHING
40-121026-0038 YOU MUST BE BLESSED INDEED TO POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE THE ABBE SMILED WELL SAID HE BUT YOU HAD ANOTHER SUBJECT FOR YOUR THOUGHTS DID YOU NOT SAY SO JUST NOW I DID
40-121026-0039 AS YET BUT ONE OF THEM LET ME HEAR THE OTHER IT WAS THIS THAT WHILE YOU HAD RELATED TO ME ALL THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR PAST LIFE YOU WERE PERFECTLY UNACQUAINTED WITH MINE YOUR LIFE MY YOUNG FRIEND HAS NOT BEEN OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH
40-121026-0040 I WOULD FAIN FIX THE SOURCE OF IT ON MAN THAT I MAY NO LONGER VENT REPROACHES UPON HEAVEN
40-121026-0041 MY FATHER AND MERCEDES COME SAID THE ABBE CLOSING HIS HIDING PLACE AND PUSHING THE BED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL SITUATION LET ME HEAR YOUR STORY DANTES OBEYED AND COMMENCED WHAT HE CALLED HIS HISTORY
40-121026-0042 BUT WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF THE ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE TO INDIA AND TWO OR THREE VOYAGES TO THE LEVANT UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE RECITAL OF HIS LAST CRUISE WITH THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN LECLERE AND THE RECEIPT OF A PACKET TO BE DELIVERED BY HIMSELF TO THE GRAND MARSHAL
40-121026-0043 HIS INTERVIEW WITH THAT PERSONAGE AND HIS RECEIVING IN PLACE OF THE PACKET BROUGHT A LETTER ADDRESSED TO A MONSIEUR NOIRTIER HIS ARRIVAL AT MARSEILLES AND INTERVIEW WITH HIS FATHER HIS AFFECTION FOR MERCEDES AND THEIR NUPTUAL FEAST
40-121026-0044 HIS ARREST AND SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION HIS TEMPORARY DETENTION AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE AND HIS FINAL IMPRISONMENT IN THE CHATEAU D'IF FROM THIS POINT EVERYTHING WAS A BLANK TO DANTES HE KNEW NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED
40-222-0000 CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE
40-222-0001 MOST BITTERLY DID SHE CRY IT WAS NOT ONLY WITH HERSELF THAT SHE WAS SUNK BUT WITH HENRY HER FOLLY WHICH NOW SEEMED EVEN CRIMINAL WAS ALL EXPOSED TO HIM AND HE MUST DESPISE HER FOREVER
40-222-0002 THE LIBERTY WHICH HER IMAGINATION HAD DARED TO TAKE WITH THE CHARACTER OF HIS FATHER COULD HE EVER FORGIVE IT THE ABSURDITY OF HER CURIOSITY AND HER FEARS COULD THEY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
40-222-0003 SHE HATED HERSELF MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS HE HAD SHE THOUGHT HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE THIS FATAL MORNING SHOWN SOMETHING LIKE AFFECTION FOR HER BUT NOW
40-222-0004 IN SHORT SHE MADE HERSELF AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WENT DOWN WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK FIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL
40-222-0005 THE FORMIDABLE HENRY SOON FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER WAS THAT HE PAID HER RATHER MORE ATTENTION THAN USUAL CATHERINE HAD NEVER WANTED COMFORT MORE AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS AWARE OF IT
40-222-0006 THE EVENING WORE AWAY WITH NO ABATEMENT OF THIS SOOTHING POLITENESS AND HER SPIRITS WERE GRADUALLY RAISED TO A MODEST TRANQUILLITY SHE DID NOT LEARN EITHER TO FORGET OR DEFEND THE PAST
40-222-0007 BUT SHE LEARNED TO HOPE THAT IT WOULD NEVER TRANSPIRE FARTHER AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT COST HER HENRY'S ENTIRE REGARD HER THOUGHTS BEING STILL CHIEFLY FIXED ON WHAT SHE HAD WITH SUCH CAUSELESS TERROR FELT AND DONE NOTHING COULD SHORTLY BE CLEARER
40-222-0008 THAN THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL A VOLUNTARY SELF CREATED DELUSION EACH TRIFLING CIRCUMSTANCE RECEIVING IMPORTANCE FROM AN IMAGINATION RESOLVED ON ALARM AND EVERYTHING FORCED TO BEND TO ONE PURPOSE BY A MIND WHICH
40-222-0009 LONG BEFORE HER QUITTING BATH AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT OF READING WHICH SHE HAD THERE INDULGED
40-222-0010 CHARMING AS WERE ALL MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S WORKS AND CHARMING EVEN AS WERE THE WORKS OF ALL HER IMITATORS IT WAS NOT IN THEM PERHAPS THAT HUMAN NATURE AT LEAST IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WAS TO BE LOOKED FOR
40-222-0011 AND EVEN OF THAT IF HARD PRESSED WOULD HAVE YIELDED THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN EXTREMITIES BUT IN THE CENTRAL PART OF ENGLAND THERE WAS SURELY SOME SECURITY FOR THE EXISTENCE EVEN OF A WIFE NOT BELOVED IN THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND THE MANNERS OF THE AGE
40-222-0012 MURDER WAS NOT TOLERATED SERVANTS WERE NOT SLAVES AND NEITHER POISON NOR SLEEPING POTIONS TO BE PROCURED LIKE RHUBARB FROM EVERY DRUGGIST AMONG THE ALPS AND PYRENEES PERHAPS THERE WERE NO MIXED CHARACTERS
40-222-0013 THERE SUCH AS WERE NOT AS SPOTLESS AS AN ANGEL MIGHT HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF A FIEND BUT IN ENGLAND IT WAS NOT SO AMONG THE ENGLISH SHE BELIEVED IN THEIR HEARTS AND HABITS
40-222-0014 UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF EVEN IN HENRY AND ELEANOR TILNEY SOME SLIGHT IMPERFECTION MIGHT HEREAFTER APPEAR
40-222-0015 AND UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE NEED NOT FEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME ACTUAL SPECKS IN THE CHARACTER OF THEIR FATHER WHO THOUGH CLEARED FROM THE GROSSLY INJURIOUS SUSPICIONS WHICH SHE MUST EVER BLUSH TO HAVE ENTERTAINED SHE DID BELIEVE
40-222-0016 UPON SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO BE NOT PERFECTLY AMIABLE HER MIND MADE UP ON THESE SEVERAL POINTS AND HER RESOLUTION FORMED OF ALWAYS JUDGING AND ACTING IN FUTURE WITH THE GREATEST GOOD SENSE
40-222-0017 SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO FORGIVE HERSELF AND BE HAPPIER THAN EVER AND THE LENIENT HAND OF TIME DID MUCH FOR HER BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS IN THE COURSE OF ANOTHER DAY HENRY'S ASTONISHING GENEROSITY
40-222-0018 AND NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT IN NEVER ALLUDING IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY TO WHAT HAD PASSED WAS OF THE GREATEST ASSISTANCE TO HER AND SOONER THAN SHE COULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HER DISTRESS HER SPIRITS BECAME ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE
40-222-0019 AND CAPABLE AS HERETOFORE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT BY ANYTHING HE SAID THERE WERE STILL SOME SUBJECTS INDEED UNDER WHICH SHE BELIEVED THEY MUST ALWAYS TREMBLE THE MENTION OF A CHEST OR A CABINET FOR INSTANCE
40-222-0020 AND SHE DID NOT LOVE THE SIGHT OF JAPAN IN ANY SHAPE BUT EVEN SHE COULD ALLOW THAT AN OCCASIONAL MEMENTO OF PAST FOLLY HOWEVER PAINFUL MIGHT NOT BE WITHOUT USE
40-222-0021 THE ANXIETIES OF COMMON LIFE BEGAN SOON TO SUCCEED TO THE ALARMS OF ROMANCE HER DESIRE OF HEARING FROM ISABELLA GREW EVERY DAY GREATER SHE WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO KNOW HOW THE BATH WORLD WENT ON AND HOW THE ROOMS WERE ATTENDED
40-222-0022 AND ESPECIALLY WAS SHE ANXIOUS TO BE ASSURED OF ISABELLA'S HAVING MATCHED SOME FINE NETTING COTTON ON WHICH SHE HAD LEFT HER INTENT AND OF HER CONTINUING ON THE BEST TERMS WITH JAMES
40-222-0023 HER ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA JAMES HAD PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD AND MISSUS ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO FULLERTON
40-222-0024 SHE THANKED HIM AS HEARTILY AS IF HE HAD WRITTEN IT HIMSELF TIS ONLY FROM JAMES HOWEVER AS SHE LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION SHE OPENED IT IT WAS FROM OXFORD AND TO THIS PURPOSE DEAR CATHERINE
40-222-0025 THOUGH GOD KNOWS WITH LITTLE INCLINATION FOR WRITING I THINK IT MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS AT AN END BETWEEN MISS THORPE AND ME I LEFT HER AND BATH YESTERDAY NEVER TO SEE EITHER AGAIN
40-222-0026 I SHALL NOT ENTER INTO PARTICULARS THEY WOULD ONLY PAIN YOU MORE YOU WILL SOON HEAR ENOUGH FROM ANOTHER QUARTER TO KNOW WHERE LIES THE BLAME
40-222-0027 THANK GOD I AM UNDECEIVED IN TIME BUT IT IS A HEAVY BLOW AFTER MY FATHER'S CONSENT HAD BEEN SO KINDLY GIVEN BUT NO MORE OF THIS SHE HAS MADE ME MISERABLE FOREVER
40-222-0028 LET ME SOON HEAR FROM YOU DEAR CATHERINE YOU ARE MY ONLY FRIEND YOUR LOVE I DO BUILD UPON I WISH YOUR VISIT AT NORTHANGER MAY BE OVER BEFORE CAPTAIN TILNEY MAKES HIS ENGAGEMENT KNOWN
40-222-0029 OR YOU WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLY CIRCUMSTANCED POOR THORPE IS IN TOWN I DREAD THE SIGHT OF HIM HIS HONEST HEART WOULD FEEL SO MUCH I HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM AND MY FATHER HER DUPLICITY HURTS ME MORE THAN ALL
40-222-0030 TILL THE VERY LAST IF I REASONED WITH HER SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER
40-222-0031 I AM ASHAMED TO THINK HOW LONG I BORE WITH IT BUT IF EVER MAN HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HIMSELF LOVED I WAS THAT MAN I CANNOT UNDERSTAND EVEN NOW
40-222-0032 WHAT SHE WOULD BE AT FOR THERE COULD BE NO NEED OF MY BEING PLAYED OFF TO MAKE HER SECURE OF TILNEY WE PARTED AT LAST BY MUTUAL CONSENT HAPPY FOR ME HAD WE NEVER MET
40-222-0033 DEAREST CATHERINE BEWARE HOW YOU GIVE YOUR HEART
