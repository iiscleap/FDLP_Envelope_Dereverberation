405-130894-0003-reverb IS DEATH BY CRUSHING THE SECOND IS DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION I DON'T MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH BY STARVATION BECAUSE THE NAUTILUS'S PROVISIONS WILL CERTAINLY LAST LONGER THAN WE WILL

405-130894-0032-reverb THIS LIFE GIVING ELASTIC FLUID COULD HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO US I HAD THOUGHT IT ALL OUT BUT TO NO AVAIL BECAUSE THE CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCED BY OUR BREATHING PERMEATED EVERY PART OF THE SHIP TO ABSORB IT WE WOULD NEED TO FILL CONTAINERS WITH POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE
