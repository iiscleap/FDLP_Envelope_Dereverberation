1355-39947-0033-reverb EVERY SUGGESTION HAS TO RELY ON THE EFFORTS AND STRUGGLES OF THE PATIENT HIMSELF AND ALL THAT THE PSYCHOTHERAPISTS CAN GIVE HIM IS HELP IN HIS OWN MORAL FIGHT HIS OWN WILL IS PRESUPPOSITION FOR BEING HYPNOTIZED

1355-39947-0049-reverb HE WAS THUS AT EVERY MOMENT DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE DEADLY POISON WITH WHICH HE COULD HAVE FULLY SATISFIED HIS CRAVING IT WAS A MORAL VICTORY WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH HE WENT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE FOR MORPHINE

1355-39947-0051-reverb WE HAVE NO MYSTIC POWER BY WHICH OUR WILL SIMPLY TAKES HOLD OF THE OTHER MAN'S WILL BUT WE INHIBIT AND SUPPRESS BY INFLUENCE ON THE IMAGINATION THOSE ABNORMAL IMPULSES WHICH RESIST THE SOUND DESIRES IF THAT WERE IMMORAL

1355-39947-0053-reverb IF IT WERE REALLY A MORAL DEMAND THAT THE WILL BE LEFT TO ITS OWN RESOURCES AND THAT NO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE COME TO STRENGTHEN ITS POWER OR REMOVE ITS HINDRANCES OR SMOOTH ITS PATH THEN WE OUGHT TO LET THE CHILDREN GROW UP AS NATURE CREATED THEM
1355-39947-0054-reverb AND OUGHT NOT TO TRY TO SUPPRESS FROM WITHOUT BY DISCIPLINE AND TRAINING BY LOVE AND ENCOURAGEMENT THE WILLFUL IMPULSES AND THE UGLY HABITS EVEN EVERY GOOD MODEL FOR IMITATION IS SUCH A SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCE FROM WITHOUT AND EVERY SOLEMN APPEAL TO LOYALTY AND FRIENDSHIP
1355-39947-0055-reverb TO PATRIOTISM AND RELIGION INCREASES THE DEGREE OF SUGGESTIBILITY THAT IS THE GLORY OF LIFE THAT THE SUGGESTIVE POWER MAY BELONG TO MORAL VALUES INSTEAD OF MERE PLEASURES BUT IT IS NOT THE AIM OF LIFE TO REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY SUGGESTION

1355-39947-0062-reverb WOULD ALSO BE A RATHER POOR AGENT OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS BUT THE PROBABILITY IS THAT SUCH A PHYSICIAN WOULD SIMPLY ABSTAIN BY PRINCIPLE FROM ALL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS HIS MISTAKE ONLY BEGINS IF FROM HIS LACK OF ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT
1355-39947-0063-reverb HE DRAWS THE CONCLUSION THAT THE METHOD ITSELF IS UNDESIRABLE THAT HIS REAL PREPARATION OUGHT TO INCLUDE PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES WE HAVE POINTED OUT BEFORE AND THE TIME SEEMS RIPE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO URGE SUCH A REFORM OF THE STUDIES

1355-39947-0065-reverb IS CERTAINLY NOT BETTER THAN A CHURCH CLINIC I CANNOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT OF PSYCHOLOGISTS TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS MERELY FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT'S SAKE NOBODY OUGHT TO BE BROUGHT INTO A HYPNOTIC OR OTHERWISE ABNORMAL STATE OF MIND
1355-39947-0066-reverb IF IT IS NOT SUGGESTED BY THE INTERESTS OF THE SUBJECT HIMSELF SCIENCE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS OR EXPERIMENTS WITH ABNORMAL MENTAL STATES ONLY UNDER THE ONE CONDITION THAT A PHYSICIAN HAS HYPNOTIZED THE SUBJECT IN THE INTERESTS OF HIS HEALTH
1355-39947-0067-reverb AND THAT THE PATIENT HAS AGREED BEFOREHAND TO ALLOW IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT ANY HYPNOTIZATION FOR MERE AMUSEMENT AND AS A PARLOR TRICK OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS

1355-39947-0071-reverb ANY ABSURD SUPERSTITION CAN BECOME ACCREDITED BECAUSE ITS CURATIVE VALUE MAY BE EQUAL TO A TRULY VALUABLE SUGGESTION THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER GREATLY IF THE WAY TO BE FREED FROM BODILY SUFFERING

1355-39947-0073-reverb NO THEORY OF THE WORLD AND OF GOD OUGHT TO GAIN AUTHORITY OVER THE MIND FROM SUCH AN EXTERNAL MOTIVE AS A BELIEF IN ITS CURATIVE EFFECTS FREEST FROM SUCH IMPLICATIONS IS CERTAINLY THE HYPNOTIC METHOD OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0074-reverb WHO DOES NOT NEED THE STRONG RELIGIOUS REENFORCEMENT OF THE SUGGESTION BECAUSE HE REENFORCES INSTEAD THE SUGGESTIBILITY OF THE PATIENT BY SLIGHT INFLUENCES ON HIS SENSES
1355-39947-0075-reverb EVEN WHERE SOUND RELIGION WITHOUT SUPERSTITION AND WITHOUT PSEUDOPHILOSOPHY STANDS BEHIND THE THERAPEUTIC WORK THE COMMUNITY WILL NOT GIVE UP THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CHURCH DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEGLECT BY IT THE INTERESTS WHICH ARE SUPERIOR

1355-39947-0079-reverb IN IMITATING THAT WHICH OTHERS CAN DO JUST AS WELL OR BETTER LOSES THE POWER TO DO THAT WHICH THE CHURCH ALONE CAN DO THE FINAL OUTCOME IS THEREFORE PRACTICALLY IN EVERY WAY THE SAME FROM WHATEVER STARTING POINT WE MAY COME WE ARE LED TO THE CONVICTION
1355-39947-0080-reverb THAT THE PHYSICIAN ALONE IS CALLED TO ADMINISTER PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC WORK BUT THAT HE NEEDS A THOROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINING BESIDES HIS MEDICAL ONE BUT THE INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT ONLY A NEGATIVE ONE

1355-39947-0082-reverb HYPNOTISM MAKES POSSIBLE THE RESHAPING OF A PATHOLOGICAL MIND IT IS A NATURAL THOUGHT TO USE THE SAME POWER FOR REMODELING PERHAPS THE LAZY OR THE INTEMPERATE THE CARELESS OR THE INATTENTIVE THE DISHONEST OR THE CRIMINAL MIND
1355-39947-0083-reverb BOTH EDUCATORS AND CRIMINOLOGISTS HAVE INDEED OFTEN RAISED SUCH QUESTIONS AND SOCIAL REFORMERS HAVE NOT SELDOM SEEN THERE WIDE PERSPECTIVES FOR SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN FUTURE TIMES

1355-39947-0085-reverb WE HAD ALWAYS TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE SUGGESTION CURES SYMPTOMS BUT NOT DISEASES IN THE SAME WAY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION MIGHT REENFORCE A SINGLE TRAIT BUT WOULD NOT REFORM THE PERSONALITY OF THE CHILD
1355-39947-0086-reverb YES THE ARTIFICIAL REENFORCEMENT OF SUCH SPECIAL FEATURES WOULD DEPRIVE EDUCATION OF THAT WHICH IS THE MOST ESSENTIAL NAMELY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POWER TO OVERCOME DIFFICULTIES BY OWN ENERGY

1355-39947-0093-reverb WHICH ARE AT HIS DISPOSAL STILL MORE COMPLEX IS THE CRIMINOLOGICAL PROBLEM IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASY REMEDY FOR THE GREATEST SOCIAL CALAMITY IF IT IS PROPOSED SIMPLY TO HYPNOTIZE THE CRIMINAL AND TO SUPPLANT HIS ANTISOCIAL WILL BY A MORAL ONE
1355-39947-0094-reverb AND IF THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH A PROPOSAL IS RECOGNIZED IT SEEMS TO MANY JUSTIFIED TO DEMAND SUCH AN INTRUSION AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THE BORN CRIMINAL EVEN IF THE OCCASIONAL CRIMINAL CANNOT BE REACHED
1355-39947-0095-reverb BUT THE CONCEPTION OF THE BORN CRIMINAL IS ALSO ONLY A LABEL WHICH IS SUPERFICIALLY USED FOR A GREAT VARIETY OF MINDS THAT MEN ARE BORN WITH A BRAIN WHICH NECESSARILY PRODUCES CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS NOT INDICATED BY ANY FACTS
