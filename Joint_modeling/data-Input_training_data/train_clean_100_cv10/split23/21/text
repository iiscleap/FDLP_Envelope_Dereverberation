8975-270782-0044 SUBSEQUENTLY EVERY OPPORTUNITY IS MADE USE OF TO DISPARAGE THE NEW ARRIVAL AND EVEN ATTEMPTS TO DO HIM BODILY HARM DIRECT ATTACKS ARE NOT UNHEARD OF
8975-270782-0045 IF THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE IS LESS THE CHILD LEARNS OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE RIVAL WITH INTENSE PSYCHIC ACTIVITY AND ACCOMMODATES HIMSELF TO THE NEW SITUATION IF THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE IS GREATER THE NEW CHILD MAY AWAKEN CERTAIN SYMPATHIES AS AN
8975-270782-0046 INTERESTING OBJECT AS A SORT OF LIVING DOLL AND IF THE DIFFERENCE IS EIGHT YEARS OR MORE MOTHERLY IMPULSES ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF GIRLS MAY COME INTO PLAY BUT TO BE TRUTHFUL WHEN WE DISCLOSE IN A DREAM THE WISH FOR THE DEATH OF A MOTHER OR SISTER
8975-270782-0047 WE NEED SELDOM FIND IT PUZZLING AND MAY TRACE ITS ORIGIN EASILY TO EARLY CHILDHOOD OFTEN ENOUGH ALSO TO THE PROPINQUITY OF LATER YEARS PROBABLY NO NURSERIES ARE FREE FROM MIGHTY CONFLICTS AMONG THE INHABITANTS
8975-270782-0048 THE MOTIVES ARE RIVALRY FOR THE LOVE OF THE PARENTS ARTICLES OWNED IN COMMON THE ROOM ITSELF THE HOSTILE IMPULSES ARE CALLED FORTH BY OLDER AS WELL AS YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8975-270782-0049 IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO HATES A YOUNG ENGLISH LADY MORE THAN DOES HER MOTHER IT IS HER ELDER SISTER THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SAYING HOWEVER THAT AROUSES OUR ANTIPATHY WE CAN AT A PINCH UNDERSTAND HATRED OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8975-270782-0050 AND RIVALRY AMONG THEM BUT HOW MAY FEELINGS OF HATRED FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DAUGHTER AND MOTHER PARENTS AND CHILDREN THIS RELATIONSHIP IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE MORE FAVORABLE EVEN WHEN LOOKED AT FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0051 THIS IS IN ACCORD WITH OUR EXPECTATION WE FIND IT MUCH MORE OFFENSIVE FOR LOVE BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN TO BE LACKING THAN FOR LOVE BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE HAVE SO TO SPEAK MADE SOMETHING HOLY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
8975-270782-0052 WHICH IN THE OTHER CASE WE PERMITTED TO REMAIN PROFANE
8975-270782-0053 THE FEELINGS BETWEEN PARENTS AND THEIR GROWN CHILDREN FAIL TO COME UP TO THE IDEAL ESTABLISHED BY SOCIETY HOW MUCH ENMITY EXISTS AND WOULD FIND EXPRESSION DID NOT ACCUMULATIONS OF PIETY AND OF TENDER IMPULSE HOLD THEM BACK THE MOTIVES FOR THIS ARE EVERYWHERE KNOWN
8975-270782-0054 AND DISCLOSE A TENDENCY TO SEPARATE THOSE OF THE SAME SEX DAUGHTER FROM MOTHER FATHER FROM SON THE DAUGHTER FINDS IN HER MOTHER THE AUTHORITY THAT HEMS IN HER WILL AND THAT IS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TASK OF CAUSING HER TO CARRY OUT
8975-270782-0055 THE ABSTENTION FROM SEXUAL LIBERTY WHICH SOCIETY DEMANDS IN CERTAIN CASES ALSO SHE IS THE RIVAL WHO OBJECTS TO BEING DISPLACED THE SAME TYPE OF THING OCCURS IN A MORE GLARING MANNER BETWEEN FATHER AND SON
8975-270782-0056 TO THE SON THE FATHER IS THE EMBODIMENT OF EVERY SOCIAL RESTRICTION BORNE WITH SUCH GREAT OPPOSITION THE FATHER BARS THE WAY TO FREEDOM OF WILL TO EARLY SEXUAL SATISFACTION
8975-270782-0057 TO THE ENJOYMENT THEREOF IMPATIENT WAITING FOR THE DEATH OF THE FATHER GROWS TO HEIGHTS APPROXIMATING TRAGEDY IN THE CASE OF A SUCCESSOR TO THE THRONE LESS STRAINED IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FATHER AND DAUGHTER MOTHER AND SON
8975-270782-0058 THE LATTER AFFORDS THE PUREST EXAMPLES OF AN UNALTERABLE TENDERNESS IN NO WAY DISTURBED BY EGOISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS WHY DO I SPEAK OF THESE THINGS SO BANAL AND SO WELL KNOWN
8975-270782-0059 BECAUSE THERE IS AN UNMISTAKABLE DISPOSITION TO DENY THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN LIFE AND TO SET FORTH THE IDEAL DEMANDED BY SOCIETY AS A FULFILLED THING MUCH OFTENER THAN IT REALLY IS FULFILLED BUT IT IS PREFERABLE FOR PSYCHOLOGY TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
8975-270782-0060 RATHER THAN THAT THIS TASK SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE CYNIC IN ANY EVENT THIS DENIAL REFERS ONLY TO ACTUAL LIFE THE ARTS OF NARRATIVE AND DRAMATIC POETRY ARE STILL FREE TO MAKE USE OF THE MOTIVES THAT RESULT FROM A DISTURBANCE OF THIS IDEAL
8975-270782-0061 IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT IN THE CASE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE DREAM DISCLOSES THE WISH FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE PARENTS ESPECIALLY THE PARENT OF THE SAME SEX WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT IT IS ALSO PRESENT DURING WAKING HOURS
8975-270782-0062 AS IN THE CASE OF THE DREAMER'S SYMPATHY FOR HIS FATHER'S UNNECESSARY SUFFERINGS IN EXAMPLE THREE IT IS SELDOM THAT THE ENMITY ALONE CONTROLS THE RELATIONSHIP MUCH MORE OFTEN IT RECEDES BEHIND MORE TENDER IMPULSES
8975-270782-0063 BY WHICH IT IS SUPPRESSED AND MUST WAIT UNTIL A DREAM ISOLATES IT THAT WHICH THE DREAM SHOWS US IN ENLARGED FORM AS A RESULT OF SUCH ISOLATION SHRINKS TOGETHER AGAIN AFTER IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY DOCKETED IN ITS RELATION TO LIFE AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERPRETATION
8975-270782-0064 H SACHS BUT WE ALSO FIND THIS DREAM WISH IN PLACES WHERE IT HAS NO CONNECTION WITH LIFE AND WHERE THE ADULT IN HIS WAKING HOURS WOULD NEVER RECOGNIZE IT THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE DEEPEST AND MOST UNIFORM MOTIVE FOR BECOMING UNFRIENDLY
8975-270782-0065 ESPECIALLY BETWEEN PERSONS OF THE SAME SEX HAS ALREADY MADE ITS INFLUENCE FELT IN EARLIEST CHILDHOOD I MEAN THE LOVE RIVALRY WITH THE ESPECIAL EMPHASIS OF THE SEX CHARACTER THE SON EVEN AS A SMALL CHILD
8975-270782-0066 WHO IS A DISTURBING ELEMENT IN HER TENDER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER FATHER AND WHO OCCUPIES A POSITION THAT SHE COULD VERY WELL FILL HERSELF ONE LEARNS FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS TO WHAT EARLY YEARS THESE IDEAS EXTEND BACK
8975-270782-0067 IDEAS WHICH WE DESIGNATE AS THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX BECAUSE THIS MYTH REALIZES WITH A VERY SLIGHTLY WEAKENED EFFECT THE TWO EXTREME WISHES WHICH GROW OUT OF THE SITUATION OF THE SON TO KILL HIS FATHER AND TAKE HIS MOTHER TO WIFE
8975-270782-0068 I DO NOT WISH TO MAINTAIN THAT THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX COVERS ENTIRELY THE RELATION OF THE CHILD TO ITS PARENTS THIS RELATION CAN BE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED FURTHERMORE THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX IS MORE OR LESS WELL DEVELOPED IT MAY EVEN EXPERIENCE A REVERSAL
8975-270782-0069 BUT IT IS A CUSTOMARY AND VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD AND ONE TENDS RATHER TO UNDERESTIMATE THAN TO OVERESTIMATE ITS INFLUENCE AND THE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAY FOLLOW FROM IT IN ADDITION
8975-270782-0070 CHILDREN FREQUENTLY REACT TO THE OEDIPUS IDEA THROUGH STIMULATION BY THE PARENTS WHO IN THE PLACING OF THEIR AFFECTION ARE OFTEN LED BY SEX DIFFERENCES SO THAT THE FATHER PREFERS THE DAUGHTER THE MOTHER THE SON
8975-270782-0071 AND THIS LOVE IS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE OUTWORN LOVE ONE CANNOT MAINTAIN THAT THE WORLD WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO PSYCHOANALYTIC RESEARCH FOR ITS DISCOVERY OF THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX ON THE CONTRARY IT CALLED FORTH THE STRONGEST RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF ADULTS
8975-270782-0072 AND PERSONS WHO HAD NEGLECTED TO TAKE PART IN DENYING THIS PROSCRIBED OR TABOOED FEELING RELATIONSHIP LATER MADE GOOD THE OMISSION BY TAKING ALL VALUE FROM THE COMPLEX THROUGH FALSE INTERPRETATIONS ACCORDING TO MY UNCHANGED CONVICTION
8975-270782-0073 CAST OUT OF LIFE WAS YIELDED UP TO POETRY AND GIVEN THE FREEST PLAY O RANK HAS SHOWN IN A CAREFUL STUDY HOW THIS VERY OEDIPUS COMPLEX HAS SUPPLIED DRAMATIC LITERATURE
8975-270782-0074 WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF MOTIVES IN UNENDING VARIATIONS DERIVATIONS AND DISGUISES ALSO IN DISTORTED FORMS SUCH AS WE RECOGNIZE TO BE THE WORK OF A CENSOR WE MAY ALSO ASCRIBE THIS OEDIPUS COMPLEX TO THOSE DREAMERS
8975-270782-0075 WHO WERE SO FORTUNATE AS TO ESCAPE IN LATER LIFE THESE CONFLICTS WITH THEIR PARENTS AND INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED THEREWITH WE FIND WHAT WE CALL THE CASTRATION COMPLEX THE REACTION TO SEXUAL INTIMIDATION OR RESTRICTION ASCRIBED TO THE FATHER
8975-270782-0076 BY APPLYING OUR FORMER RESEARCHES TO THE STUDY OF THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD WE MAY EXPECT TO FIND THAT THE ORIGIN OF OTHER FORBIDDEN DREAM WISHES OF EXCESSIVE SEXUAL IMPULSES MAY BE EXPLAINED IN THE SAME MANNER
8975-270782-0077 THUS WE ARE MOVED TO STUDY THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEX LIFE IN THE CHILD ALSO AND WE DISCOVER THE FOLLOWING FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS A MISTAKE TO DENY THAT THE CHILD HAS A SEXUAL LIFE AND TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED
8975-270782-0078 THAT SEXUALITY COMMENCES WITH THE RIPENING OF THE GENITALS AT THE TIME OF PUBERTY ON THE CONTRARY THE CHILD HAS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING A SEXUAL LIFE RICH IN CONTENT AND DIFFERING IN NUMEROUS RESPECTS
8975-270782-0079 WHAT WE CALL PERVERSE IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT DIFFERS FROM THE NORMAL IN THE FOLLOWING RESPECTS FIRST IN DISREGARD FOR THE DIVIDING LINE OF SPECIES THE GULF BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL SECOND
8975-270782-0080 BEING INSENSIBLE TO THE CONVENTIONAL FEELING OF DISGUST THIRD THE INCEST LIMITATION BEING PROHIBITED FROM SEEKING SEXUAL SATISFACTION WITH NEAR BLOOD RELATIONS FOURTH HOMOSEXUALITY AND FIFTH
8975-270782-0081 HE KNOWS NO UNBRIDGABLE CHASM BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL THE ARROGANCE WITH WHICH MAN DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF FROM THE ANIMAL IS A LATER ACQUISITION IN THE BEGINNING HE IS NOT DISGUSTED AT THE SIGHT OF EXCREMENT BUT SLOWLY LEARNS TO BE SO DISGUSTED
8975-270782-0082 UNDER THE PRESSURE OF EDUCATION HE LAYS NO SPECIAL STRESS ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEXES RATHER ACCREDITS TO BOTH THE SAME GENITAL FORMATION
8975-270782-0083 TOWARD THOSE PERSONS CLOSEST TO HIM AND WHO ARE DEAR TO HIM FOR VARIOUS REASONS HIS PARENTS BROTHERS AND SISTERS NURSES AND FINALLY YOU MAY OBSERVE IN HIM THAT WHICH LATER BREAKS THROUGH AGAIN RAISED NOW TO A LOVE ATTRACTION
8975-270782-0084 POLYMORPHUS PERVERSE AND IF HE MAKES BUT SLIGHT USE OF ALL THESE IMPULSES IT IS ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE OF THEIR LESSER INTENSITY AS COMPARED TO LATER LIFE AND ON THE OTHER HAND
8975-270782-0085 AND TO DISGUISE ANOTHER PART BY MISREPRESENTING ITS SEXUAL NATURE UNTIL THEY CAN DENY THE WHOLE BUSINESS THESE ARE OFTEN THE SAME PERSONS WHO DISCOURSE VIOLENTLY AGAINST ALL THE SEXUAL FAULTS OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0086 AND THEN AT THE WRITING TABLE DEFEND THE SEXUAL PURITY OF THE SAME CHILDREN WHERE CHILDREN ARE LEFT TO THEMSELVES OR ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CORRUPTION
8975-270782-0087 OF PERVERSE SEXUAL ACTIVITY TO BE SURE THE GROWN UPS ARE RIGHT IN LOOKING UPON THESE THINGS AS CHILDISH PERFORMANCES AS PLAY FOR THE CHILD IS NOT TO BE JUDGED AS MATURE AND ANSWERABLE EITHER BEFORE THE BAR OF CUSTOM OR BEFORE THE LAW
8975-270782-0088 BUT THESE THINGS DO EXIST THEY HAVE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AS INDICATIONS OF INNATE CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS CAUSES AND FURTHERANCES OF LATER DEVELOPMENTS THEY GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO CHILDHOOD SEX LIFE AND THEREBY INTO THE SEX LIFE OF MAN
8975-270782-0089 WHEN WE REDISCOVER IN THE BACKGROUND OF OUR DISTORTED DREAMS ALL THESE PERVERSE WISH IMPULSES IT MEANS ONLY THAT THE DREAM HAS IN THIS FIELD
8975-270782-0090 THOSE DIRECTED TOWARDS SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH PARENTS AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS YOU KNOW WHAT ANTIPATHY SOCIETY FEELS TOWARD SUCH INTERCOURSE OR AT LEAST PRETENDS TO FEEL AND WHAT WEIGHT IS LAID ON THE PROHIBITIONS DIRECTED AGAINST IT
8975-270782-0091 THE MOST MONSTROUS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO EXPLAIN THIS FEAR OF INCEST SOME HAVE BELIEVED THAT IT IS DUE TO EVOLUTIONARY FORESIGHT ON THE PART OF NATURE WHICH IS PSYCHICALLY REPRESENTED BY THIS PROHIBITION BECAUSE INBREEDING WOULD DETERIORATE THE RACE CHARACTER
8975-270782-0092 OTHERS MAINTAINED THAT BECAUSE OF HAVING LIVED TOGETHER SINCE EARLY CHILDHOOD THE SEXUAL DESIRE IS DIVERTED FROM THE PERSONS UNDER CONSIDERATION IN BOTH CASES FURTHERMORE THE INCEST AVOIDANCE WOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY ASSURED
8975-270782-0093 AND MOST CUSTOMARY CHOICE AND THAT NOT UNTIL LATER IS THERE ANY RESISTANCE THE SOURCE OF WHICH PROBABLY IS TO BE FOUND IN THE INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY
8975-270782-0094 TOWARD THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DREAM WE FOUND NOT ONLY THAT THE MATERIALS OF FORGOTTEN CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ARE ACCESSIBLE TO THE DREAM
8975-270782-0095 WITH ALL ITS PECULIARITIES ITS EGOISM ITS INCESTUOUS LOVE CHOICE ET CETERA CONTINUES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE DREAM IN THE UNCONSCIOUS
8975-270782-0096 INFANTILE SIDE OF PSYCHIC LIFE WHICH WE MAY FIND IN ACTION IN CHILDREN WHICH WE OVERLOOK PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE SLIGHTNESS OF ITS DIMENSIONS PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS LIGHTLY CONSIDERED SINCE WE DEMAND NO ETHICAL HEIGHTS OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0097 SINCE THE DREAM REGRESSES TO THIS STAGE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE APPARENT THE EVIL THAT LIES IN US BUT IT IS ONLY A DECEPTIVE APPEARANCE BY WHICH WE HAVE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO BE FRIGHTENED WE ARE NOT SO EVIL AS WE MIGHT SUSPECT FROM THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS
8975-270782-0098 IF THE EVIL IMPULSES OF THE DREAM ARE MERELY INFANTILISM A RETURN TO THE BEGINNINGS OF OUR ETHICAL DEVELOPMENT SINCE THE DREAM SIMPLY MAKES CHILDREN OF US AGAIN IN THINKING AND IN FEELING WE NEED NOT BE ASHAMED OF THESE EVIL DREAMS IF WE ARE REASONABLE
8975-270782-0099 BUT BEING REASONABLE IS ONLY A PART OF PSYCHIC LIFE MANY THINGS ARE TAKING PLACE THERE THAT ARE NOT REASONABLE AND SO IT HAPPENS THAT WE ARE ASHAMED OF SUCH DREAMS AND UNREASONABLY WE TURN THEM OVER TO THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
8975-270782-0100 ARE ASHAMED AND ANGRY IF ONE OF THESE DREAMS HAS IN SOME UNUSUAL MANNER SUCCEEDED IN PENETRATING INTO CONSCIOUSNESS IN AN UNDISTORTED FORM
8975-270782-0101 AS WE WOULD BE IF WE UNDERSTOOD IT JUST THINK OF THE SCANDALIZED OPINION OF THE FINE OLD LADY ABOUT HER UNINTERPRETED DREAM OF SERVICES OF LOVE THE PROBLEM IS NOT YET SOLVED
8975-270782-0102 AND IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT UPON FURTHER STUDY OF THE EVIL IN THE DREAM WE SHALL COME TO SOME OTHER DECISION AND ARRIVE AT ANOTHER VALUATION OF HUMAN NATURE AS A RESULT OF THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION WE GRASP TWO FACTS
8975-270782-0103 WHICH HOWEVER DISCLOSE ONLY THE BEGINNINGS OF NEW RIDDLES NEW DOUBTS FIRST THE REGRESSION OF DREAM WORK IS NOT ONLY FORMAL IT IS ALSO OF GREATER IMPORT IT NOT ONLY TRANSLATES OUR THOUGHTS INTO A PRIMITIVE FORM OF EXPRESSION
8975-270782-0104 BUT IT REAWAKENS THE PECULIARITIES OF OUR PRIMITIVE PSYCHIC LIFE THE ANCIENT PREDOMINANCE OF THE EGO THE EARLIEST IMPULSES OF OUR SEXUAL LIFE EVEN OUR OLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
8975-270782-0105 UNCONSCIOUS IS NO LONGER A NAME FOR WHAT IS AT THAT TIME LATENT THE UNCONSCIOUS IS AN ESPECIAL PSYCHIC REALM WITH WISH IMPULSES OF ITS OWN WITH ITS OWN METHOD OF EXPRESSION AND WITH A PSYCHIC MECHANISM PECULIAR TO ITSELF
8975-270782-0106 BUT THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHTS WHICH WE HAVE SOLVED BY MEANS OF THE DREAM INTERPRETATION ARE NOT OF THIS REALM THEY ARE MUCH MORE NEARLY THE SAME AS ANY WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT IN OUR WAKING HOURS STILL THEY ARE UNCONSCIOUS
8975-270782-0107 HOW DOES ONE SOLVE THIS CONTRADICTION WE BEGIN TO SEE THAT A DISTINCTION MUST BE MADE SOMETHING THAT ORIGINATES IN OUR CONSCIOUS LIFE AND THAT SHARES ITS CHARACTERISTICS
8975-270782-0108 THE DAY REMNANTS COMBINES IN THE DREAM FABRICATION
8975-270782-0109 BETWEEN THESE TWO PARTS THE DREAM WORK COMPLETES ITSELF THE INFLUENCING OF THE DAY REMNANTS BY THE UNCONSCIOUS NECESSITATES REGRESSION THIS IS THE DEEPEST INSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF THE DREAM
8975-270782-0110 THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ATTAIN WITHOUT HAVING SEARCHED THROUGH FURTHER PSYCHIC REALMS THE TIME WILL SOON COME HOWEVER WHEN WE SHALL CLOTHE THE UNCONSCIOUS CHARACTER OF THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHT WITH ANOTHER NAME
8975-270782-0111 WHICH SHALL DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS OUT OF THE REALM OF THE INFANTILE WE MAY TO BE SURE PROPOUND THE QUESTION WHAT FORCES THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ACTIVITY DURING SLEEP TO SUCH REGRESSION
8975-270782-0112 WHY DO NOT THE SLEEP DISTURBING PSYCHIC STIMULI DO THE JOB WITHOUT IT AND IF THEY MUST BECAUSE OF THE DREAM CENSORSHIP DISGUISE THEMSELVES THROUGH OLD FORMS OF EXPRESSION WHICH ARE NO LONGER COMPREHENSIBLE
8975-270782-0113 WHAT IS THE USE OF GIVING NEW LIFE TO OLD LONG OUTGROWN PSYCHIC STIMULI WISHES AND CHARACTER TYPES THAT IS WHY THE MATERIAL REGRESSION IN ADDITION TO THE FORMAL THE ONLY SATISFACTORY ANSWER WOULD BE THIS
8975-270782-0114 THAT ONLY IN THIS MANNER CAN A DREAM BE BUILT UP
909-131041-0000 THE MODE OF APPOINTMENT OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE OF THE UNITED STATES IS ALMOST THE ONLY PART OF THE SYSTEM OF ANY CONSEQUENCE WHICH HAS ESCAPED WITHOUT SEVERE CENSURE OR WHICH HAS RECEIVED THE SLIGHTEST MARK OF APPROBATION FROM ITS OPPONENTS
909-131041-0001 THE MOST PLAUSIBLE OF THESE WHO HAS APPEARED IN PRINT
909-131041-0002 AND HESITATE NOT TO AFFIRM THAT IF THE MANNER OF IT BE NOT PERFECT IT IS AT LEAST EXCELLENT
909-131041-0003 BUT TO MEN CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE SPECIAL PURPOSE AND AT THE PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE IT WAS EQUALLY DESIRABLE THAT THE IMMEDIATE ELECTION SHOULD BE MADE BY MEN MOST CAPABLE OF ANALYZING THE QUALITIES ADAPTED TO THE STATION
909-131041-0004 AND ACTING UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES FAVORABLE TO DELIBERATION AND TO A JUDICIOUS COMBINATION OF ALL THE REASONS AND INDUCEMENTS WHICH WERE PROPER TO GOVERN THEIR CHOICE A SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS
909-131041-0005 SELECTED BY THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS FROM THE GENERAL MASS WILL BE MOST LIKELY TO POSSESS THE INFORMATION AND DISCERNMENT REQUISITE TO SUCH COMPLICATED INVESTIGATIONS
909-131041-0006 BUT THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO HAPPILY CONCERTED IN THE SYSTEM UNDER CONSIDERATION PROMISE AN EFFECTUAL SECURITY AGAINST THIS MISCHIEF THE CHOICE OF SEVERAL TO FORM AN INTERMEDIATE BODY OF ELECTORS
909-131041-0007 WILL BE MUCH LESS APT TO CONVULSE THE COMMUNITY WITH ANY EXTRAORDINARY OR VIOLENT MOVEMENTS THAN THE CHOICE OF ONE WHO WAS HIMSELF TO BE THE FINAL OBJECT OF THE PUBLIC WISHES AND AS THE ELECTORS CHOSEN IN EACH STATE
909-131041-0008 ARE TO ASSEMBLE AND VOTE IN THE STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE CHOSEN THIS DETACHED AND DIVIDED SITUATION WILL EXPOSE THEM MUCH LESS TO HEATS AND FERMENTS WHICH MIGHT BE COMMUNICATED FROM THEM TO THE PEOPLE THAN IF THEY WERE ALL TO BE CONVENED
909-131041-0009 AT ONE TIME IN ONE PLACE NOTHING WAS MORE TO BE DESIRED THAN THAT EVERY PRACTICABLE OBSTACLE SHOULD BE OPPOSED TO CABAL INTRIGUE AND CORRUPTION
909-131041-0010 THESE MOST DEADLY ADVERSARIES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT NATURALLY HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MAKE THEIR APPROACHES FROM MORE THAN ONE QUARTER BUT CHIEFLY FROM THE DESIRE IN FOREIGN POWERS TO GAIN AN IMPROPER ASCENDANT IN OUR COUNCILS
909-131041-0011 HOW COULD THEY BETTER GRATIFY THIS THAN BY RAISING A CREATURE OF THEIR OWN TO THE CHIEF MAGISTRACY OF THE UNION BUT THE CONVENTION HAVE GUARDED AGAINST ALL DANGER OF THIS SORT WITH THE MOST PROVIDENT AND JUDICIOUS ATTENTION
909-131041-0012 THEY HAVE NOT MADE THE APPOINTMENT OF THE PRESIDENT TO DEPEND ON ANY PREEXISTING BODIES OF MEN WHO MIGHT BE TAMPERED WITH BEFOREHAND TO PROSTITUTE THEIR VOTES BUT THEY HAVE REFERRED IT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO AN IMMEDIATE ACT OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA
909-131041-0013 TO BE EXERTED IN THE CHOICE OF PERSONS FOR THE TEMPORARY AND SOLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE APPOINTMENT AND THEY HAVE EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY TO THIS TRUST ALL THOSE WHO FROM SITUATION MIGHT BE SUSPECTED OF TOO GREAT DEVOTION TO THE PRESIDENT IN OFFICE
909-131041-0014 NO SENATOR REPRESENTATIVE OR OTHER PERSON HOLDING A PLACE OF TRUST OR PROFIT UNDER THE UNITED STATES CAN BE OF THE NUMBERS OF THE ELECTORS THUS WITHOUT CORRUPTING THE BODY OF THE PEOPLE THE IMMEDIATE AGENTS IN THE ELECTION
909-131041-0015 WILL AT LEAST ENTER UPON THE TASK FREE FROM ANY SINISTER BIAS THEIR TRANSIENT EXISTENCE AND THEIR DETACHED SITUATION ALREADY TAKEN NOTICE OF AFFORD A SATISFACTORY PROSPECT OF THEIR CONTINUING SO TO THE CONCLUSION OF IT
909-131041-0016 THE BUSINESS OF CORRUPTION WHEN IT IS TO EMBRACE SO CONSIDERABLE A NUMBER OF MEN REQUIRES TIME AS WELL AS MEANS NOR WOULD IT BE FOUND EASY SUDDENLY TO EMBARK THEM DISPERSED AS THEY WOULD BE OVER THIRTEEN STATES
909-131041-0017 IN ANY COMBINATIONS FOUNDED UPON MOTIVES WHICH THOUGH THEY COULD NOT PROPERLY BE DENOMINATED CORRUPT MIGHT YET BE OF A NATURE TO MISLEAD THEM FROM THEIR DUTY
909-131041-0018 ON ALL BUT THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES
909-131041-0019 THIS ADVANTAGE WILL ALSO BE SECURED BY MAKING HIS RE ELECTION TO DEPEND ON A SPECIAL BODY OF REPRESENTATIVES DEPUTED BY THE SOCIETY FOR THE SINGLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE IMPORTANT CHOICE ALL THESE ADVANTAGES WILL HAPPILY COMBINE IN THE PLAN DEVISED BY THE CONVENTION
909-131041-0020 WHICH IS THAT THE PEOPLE OF EACH STATE SHALL CHOOSE A NUMBER OF PERSONS AS ELECTORS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF SUCH STATE IN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WHO SHALL ASSEMBLE WITHIN THE STATE AND VOTE FOR SOME FIT PERSON AS PRESIDENT
909-131041-0021 AND THE PERSON WHO MAY HAPPEN TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE WHOLE NUMBER OF VOTES WILL BE THE PRESIDENT BUT AS A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES MIGHT NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN TO CENTRE IN ONE MAN AND AS IT MIGHT BE UNSAFE TO PERMIT LESS THAN A MAJORITY TO BE CONCLUSIVE
909-131041-0022 IT IS PROVIDED THAT IN SUCH A CONTINGENCY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SHALL SELECT OUT OF THE CANDIDATES WHO SHALL HAVE THE FIVE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES THE MAN WHO IN THEIR OPINION MAY BE BEST QUALIFIED FOR THE OFFICE
909-131041-0023 THE PROCESS OF ELECTION AFFORDS A MORAL CERTAINTY THAT THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT WILL NEVER FALL TO THE LOT OF ANY MAN WHO IS NOT IN AN EMINENT DEGREE ENDOWED WITH THE REQUISITE QUALIFICATIONS TALENTS FOR LOW INTRIGUE
909-131041-0024 AND THE LITTLE ARTS OF POPULARITY MAY ALONE SUFFICE TO ELEVATE A MAN TO THE FIRST HONORS IN A SINGLE STATE BUT IT WILL REQUIRE OTHER TALENTS AND A DIFFERENT KIND OF MERIT TO ESTABLISH HIM IN THE ESTEEM AND CONFIDENCE OF THE WHOLE UNION
909-131041-0025 OR OF SO CONSIDERABLE A PORTION OF IT AS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAKE HIM A SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE FOR THE DISTINGUISHED OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IT WILL NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY THAT THERE WILL BE A CONSTANT PROBABILITY OF SEEING THE STATION FILLED BY CHARACTERS
909-131041-0026 PRE EMINENT FOR ABILITY AND VIRTUE AND THIS WILL BE THOUGHT NO INCONSIDERABLE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CONSTITUTION BY THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE SHARE WHICH THE EXECUTIVE IN EVERY GOVERNMENT MUST NECESSARILY HAVE IN ITS GOOD OR ILL ADMINISTRATION
