VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2042 AND THE ONLY TRUCK WE HAD AVAILABLE WAS IN THAT BURNING SHED THE SUPERINTENDENT ADDED BITTERLY 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2043 THE TELEPHONE LINE WAS SOON REPAIRED AND A STEADY STREAM OF RESCUE VEHICLES BEGAN ARRIVING FROM HARKNESS FIRE TRUCKS THREE AMBULANCES AND PRIVATE CARS DRIVEN BY VOLUNTEERS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2044 AND THERE CAME AGAIN FROM THE BLACK SHADOWS THE SOUND OF A MOVING THING AND A FAINT RUSTLING AS OF DEAD LEAVES THE SHOCK TO MY ALREADY OVERSTRAINED NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE IN THE EXTREME AND WITH A SUPERHUMAN EFFORT I STROVE TO BREAK MY AWFUL BONDS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2045 IT WAS AN EFFORT OF THE MIND OF THE WILL OF THE NERVES NOT MUSCULAR FOR I COULD NOT MOVE EVEN SO MUCH AS MY LITTLE FINGER BUT NONE THE LESS MIGHTY FOR ALL THAT AND THEN SOMETHING GAVE THERE WAS A MOMENTARY FEELING OF NAUSEA 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2046 THE FOREMOST VESSEL SWUNG BROADSIDE TOWARD US AND BRINGING HER GUNS INTO PLAY RETURNED OUR FIRE AT THE SAME TIME MOVING PARALLEL TO OUR FRONT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND THEN TURNING BACK WITH THE EVIDENT INTENTION OF COMPLETING A GREAT CIRCLE WHICH WOULD BRING HER UP TO POSITION ONCE MORE OPPOSITE OUR FIRING LINE 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2047 AS I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD CARE TO ENTRUST SUCH AS YOU WITH THE GRAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF MATERNITY I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH MY EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN THIS RED WOMAN RETORTED SOLA SHE HAS NEVER HARMED US NOR WOULD SHE SHOULD WE HAVE FALLEN INTO HER HANDS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2048 ITS HOT RAYS COOLED HIM OFF SOMEWHAT SO THAT HE BEGAN LOOKING ABOUT CURIOUSLY AT ALL THE STRANGE SIGHTS AND WONDERING WHERE ON EARTH HE WAS BY AND BY A FARMER CAME ALONG THE ROAD BY THE RIVER 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2049 OVERBEARING IN TEMPER OF MELANCHOLY MOOD SILENT AT ALL TIMES UNDERHAND IN HIS DEALINGS AND WITHAL GIVEN TO ABUSE AND ALWAYS INCLINED TOWARDS THE WORST HE HAD KEPT HIMSELF ALOOF FROM THE TRUE FAITH WHEN IT CAME TO GREENLAND 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2050 OVERBEARING IN TEMPER OF MELANCHOLY MOOD SILENT AT ALL TIMES UNDERHAND IN HIS DEALINGS AND WITHAL GIVEN TO ABUSE AND ALWAYS INCLINED TOWARDS THE WORST HE HAD KEPT HIMSELF ALOOF FROM THE TRUE FAITH WHEN IT CAME TO GREENLAND 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2051 HE WAS BUT LITTLE ENCOMPASSED WITH THE LOVE OF FRIENDS BUT YET EIRIK HAD LONG HELD CONVERSATION WITH HIM HE WENT IN THE SHIP WITH THORVALD AND HIS MAN BECAUSE HE WAS WIDELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE UNPEOPLED DISTRICTS THEY HAD THE SHIP WHICH THORBJORN HAD BROUGHT TO GREENLAND 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2052 MISTER STEELE I DO NOT MEAN YOU TO DISTURB MY HOUSE OR TO ROB ME OF MY WIFE WHAT WAS YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOU MET OLYMPIA BREWSTER A PAUSE THE SLIGHTEST IN THE WORLD BUT THE KEEN EYE OF THE ASTUTE LAWYER NOTED IT 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2053 THE OTHERS GATHERED ROUND AND STARED FOR A SPACE AT LAST WE DREW NEAR THE WESTWARD EXTREMITY OF THE ISLAND WE CAME UPON THE GNAWED AND MUTILATED BODY OF THE PUMA ITS SHOULDER BONE SMASHED BY A BULLET AND PERHAPS TWENTY YARDS FARTHER FOUND AT LAST WHAT WE SOUGHT 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2054 ON CARRY HIM FAR THEY WENT IN UP TO THEIR ARMPITS AND STOOD REGARDING ME LET GO SAID I AND THE BODY OF MONTGOMERY VANISHED WITH A SPLASH SOMETHING SEEMED TO TIGHTEN ACROSS MY CHEST GOOD SAID I WITH A BREAK IN MY VOICE 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2055 TOWARDS NOON CERTAIN OF THEM CAME AND SQUATTED BASKING IN THE HOT SAND THE IMPERIOUS VOICES OF HUNGER AND THIRST PREVAILED OVER MY DREAD I CAME OUT OF THE BUSHES AND REVOLVER IN HAND WALKED DOWN TOWARDS THESE SEATED FIGURES ONE A WOLF WOMAN TURNED HER HEAD AND STARED AT ME 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2056 IS THE FIRST RESTORATION OF THE SELF RESPECT A MAN HAS LOST OUR IDEAL OF WHAT HE IS BECOMES TO HIM THE HOPE AND PATTERN OF WHAT HE MAY BECOME 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2057 HIS ELEVATION ABOVE EVERYONE THE IDENTITY OF HIS SOBER INTERESTS WITH THOSE OF THE STATE AT LARGE IS CALCULATED TO MAKE HIM THE PEOPLE'S NATURAL REPRESENTATIVE HIS WORD HAS THEREFORE A GENUINE AUTHORITY AND HIS ASCENDENCY NOT BEING INVIDIOUS IS ABLE TO SECURE INTERNAL PEACE EVEN WHEN NOT ENLIGHTENED ENOUGH TO INSURE PROSPERITY OR TO AVOID FOREIGN WARS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2058 APPARENTLY CROSSED BY SOME THOUGHT WHICH JARS WITH THE SINGING PERHAPS IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN ALREADY IN THE SECRET YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE GUESSED WHAT SAD MEMORIES WHAT WARM AFFECTION WHAT TENDER FLUTTERING HOPES HAD THEIR HOME IN THIS ATHLETIC BODY WITH THE BROKEN FINGER NAILS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2059 PAUL CHOSE LUELLA FOR LUELLA WAS THE NURSE WHO HAD BEEN WITH HIM DURING HIS WHOLE BABYHOOD UP TO THE TIME OF HIS FIRST TROUSERS AND THE NAME SUGGESTED ALL SORTS OF COMFORTABLE THINGS UNCLE JACK SAID THAT THE FIRST GIRL SHOULD ALWAYS BE NAMED FOR HER MOTHER NO MATTER HOW HIDEOUS THE NAME HAPPENED TO BE 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2060 THE HITHERTO BABY IF THAT IS A POSSIBLE TERM SAT IN ONE CORNER AND SAID NOTHING BUT FELT IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY THAT HIS NOSE WAS OUT OF JOINT FOR THERE WAS A NEWER BABY NOW A POSSIBILITY HE HAD NEVER TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND THE FIRST GIRL TOO 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2061 AND I HOPE THAT BEING A GIRL THIS BABY HAS SOME CHANCE OF BEING AS LOVELY AS HER MOTHER AT WHICH SPEECH FROM THE BABY'S PAPA MISSUS BIRD THOUGH SHE WAS AS WEAK AND TIRED AS SHE COULD BE BLUSHED WITH HAPPINESS AND SO CAROL CAME BY HER NAME

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2068 IN FORMER TIMES EVERY WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD OR PASSED THROUGH A MISCARRIAGE WAS EXPOSED TO GRAVE DANGER OF INFECTION OR CHILD BED FEVER BUT AT PRESENT THANKS TO THE RECOGNITION OF THE BACTERIAL ORIGIN OF THE DISEASE AND OF ITS IDENTITY WITH WOUND INFECTION 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2069 FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE ALMOST TOTALLY IGNORANT OF THE STIMULUS WHICH CAUSES THE MOTHER TO FALL INTO LABOR APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AFTER THE LAST NORMAL MENSTRUATION THERE ARE TWO POINTS WHICH I DESIRE TO IMPRESS ESPECIALLY UPON THE READERS OF THIS BOOK 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2070 AND HAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED A VERY PRETTY RING WHICH SHE WEARS SO I CONCLUDE THAT SHE HAS LEARNED TO THINK OF OTHER PEOPLE MORE AND OF HERSELF LESS AND HAS DECIDED TO TRY AND MOLD HER CHARACTER AS CAREFULLY AS SHE MOLDS HER LITTLE CLAY FIGURES
