VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3857 DRAWBACKS HOWEVER IT MUST ALWAYS BE UNDERSTOOD ARE USEFUL ONLY IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH THE GOODS FOR THE EXPORTATION OF WHICH THEY ARE GIVEN ARE REALLY EXPORTED TO SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY AND NOT CLANDESTINELY RE IMPORTED INTO OUR OWN 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3858 NECESSARY OR USEFUL FOR SUPPLYING THEIR OCCASIONAL WANTS AND WHO CONTRIBUTE STILL FURTHER TO AUGMENT THE TOWN THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN AND THOSE OF THE COUNTRY ARE MUTUALLY THE SERVANTS OF ONE ANOTHER THE TOWN IS A CONTINUAL FAIR OR MARKET 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3859 BUT SHE HAD EXPECTED TO VIEW THE COMPANY THROUGH A BOWER OF ORCHIDS AND EAT PRETTY COLOURED ENTREES IN RUFFLED PAPERS INSTEAD THERE WAS ONLY A LOW CENTRE DISH OF FERNS AND PLAIN ROASTED AND BROILED MEAT THAT ONE COULD RECOGNIZE AS IF THEY'D BEEN DYSPEPTICS ON A DIET

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3862 IS SELDOM SEEN WITH SO MUCH SPLENDOR I REMEMBER ANOTHER SIMILAR ONE SEEN FROM THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO ON THIS LAST OCCASION SOME OBSERVERS SAW A GREAT UPRIGHT BEAM OF LIGHT WHICH MAJESTICALLY MOVED ACROSS THE HEAVENS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3863 OF THAT SAME BAR SHOE JUST AS DESCRIBED BY WEBB THEN WITH LONG SWIFT STRIDES HE CAME STALKING UP THE HILL AGAIN PASSING THE WATCHFUL EYES ABOUT THE CORRAL WITHOUT A STOP AND ONLY CHECKING SPEED AS HE NEARED THE HOMESTEAD OF THE HAYS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3864 WHERE ONCE AGAIN HE BECAME ENGROSSED IN STUDYING THE ROAD AND THE HARD PATHWAYS AT THE SIDE SOMETHING THAT HE SAW OR FANCIED THAT HE SAW PERHAPS A DOZEN YARDS FROM THE TRADER'S GATE INDUCED HIM TO STOP SCRUTINIZE TURN AND WITH SEARCHING EYES 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3865 THAT ONE REASON PROBABLY WHY SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO OPPOSE NO STOUTER RESISTANCE TO SO SLENDER A GIRL AS ESTHER DADE WAS THAT SHE WAS ALREADY HALF DAZED THROUGH THE STROKE OF SOME BLUNT HEAVY WEAPON WIELDED PROBABLY BY HIM SHE WAS RISKING ALL TO SAVE 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3866 BUT WHAT HE JUSTLY EARNS HIS WISHES AND PRAYERS ARE ONLY GRATIFIED AND ANSWERED WHEN THEY HARMONIZE WITH HIS THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS IN THE LIGHT OF THIS TRUTH WHAT THEN IS THE MEANING OF FIGHTING AGAINST CIRCUMSTANCES 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3867 AND TRUE CONCENTRATION OF THOUGHT EVEN IF HE FAILS AGAIN AND AGAIN TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE AS HE NECESSARILY MUST UNTIL WEAKNESS IS OVERCOME THE STRENGTH OF CHARACTER GAINED WILL BE THE MEASURE OF HIS TRUE SUCCESS
