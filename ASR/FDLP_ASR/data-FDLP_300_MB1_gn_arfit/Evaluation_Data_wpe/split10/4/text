VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1418 BUT THEN HE HAD A WEAKNESS FOR CONCERTS AND GENERAL SOCIETY BECAUSE HE WAS HELD TO BE BY ALL ODDS THE HANDSOMEST BIRD IN THE WOODS AND SUNG LIKE AN ANGEL AND SO THE TRUTH WAS HE DIDN'T CONFINE HIMSELF SO MUCH TO THE DOMESTIC NEST AS TOM TITMOUSE OR BILLY WREN

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1445 THIS GAVE REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT OUR DESCENT WAS MORE HORIZONTAL THAN VERTICAL AS FOR THE EXACT DEPTH REACHED IT WAS VERY EASY TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE PROFESSOR MEASURED ACCURATELY THE ANGLES OF DEVIATION AND INCLINATION ON THE ROAD BUT HE KEPT THE RESULTS TO HIMSELF 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1446 BY MANY PASSAGES HAD NOT CEASED WHEN LUCIE STOOD STRETCHING OUT HER ARMS TOWARDS HER HUSBAND WITH NOTHING IN HER FACE BUT LOVE AND CONSOLATION IF I MIGHT TOUCH HIM IF I MIGHT EMBRACE HIM ONCE O GOOD CITIZENS IF YOU WOULD HAVE SO MUCH COMPASSION FOR US
