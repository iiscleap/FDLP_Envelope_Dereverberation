VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_4439 IS SELDOM SEEN WITH SO MUCH SPLENDOR I REMEMBER ANOTHER SIMILAR ONE SEEN FROM THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO ON THIS LAST OCCASION SOME OBSERVERS SAW A GREAT UPRIGHT BEAM OF LIGHT WHICH MAJESTICALLY MOVED ACROSS THE HEAVENS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_4440 THE DISCOVERY THAT THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE IS AFFECTED BY THE AURORA QUIVERING AND DARTING ABOUT IN A STATE OF EXTRAORDINARY EXCITEMENT WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE PLAYING IN THE SKY ONLY ADDED TO THE MYSTERY OF THE PHENOMENON UNTIL ITS ELECTRO MAGNETIC NATURE HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_4441 WHERE ONCE AGAIN HE BECAME ENGROSSED IN STUDYING THE ROAD AND THE HARD PATHWAYS AT THE SIDE SOMETHING THAT HE SAW OR FANCIED THAT HE SAW PERHAPS A DOZEN YARDS FROM THE TRADER'S GATE INDUCED HIM TO STOP SCRUTINIZE TURN AND WITH SEARCHING EYES 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_4442 WHERE ONCE AGAIN HE BECAME ENGROSSED IN STUDYING THE ROAD AND THE HARD PATHWAYS AT THE SIDE SOMETHING THAT HE SAW OR FANCIED THAT HE SAW PERHAPS A DOZEN YARDS FROM THE TRADER'S GATE INDUCED HIM TO STOP SCRUTINIZE TURN AND WITH SEARCHING EYES 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_4443 AND FIRED THRICE INTO EMPTY SPACE AND A SHOUT OF WRATH AND RENEWED CHALLENGE TO COME BACK AND FIGHT IT OUT RANG OUT AFTER THE SIOUX FOR TO THE AMAZE OF THE LATELY BESIEGED TO THE IMPOTENT FURY OF THE IRISHMAN IN UNMISTAKABLE YET MOSTLY UNQUOTABLE ENGLISH 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_4444 THEN SHE LAUGHED AND SAID GOOD NIGHT AND WENT ON TO THE HOSPITAL WHAT BECAME OF THE WINE SHE HAD POURED OUT THIS FROM THE GRIM AND HITHERTO SILENT DOCTOR SEATED BY THE BEDSIDE SHE MUST HAVE TOSSED IT OUT OR DRUNK IT HERSELF PERHAPS SIX DIDN'T KNOW 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_4445 MISS MC GRATH HADN'T BEEN SPYING OF COURSE BECAUSE HER ROOM WAS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE BEYOND THE KITCHEN BUT HOW DID THE LITTLE HEEL TRACKS GET ON THE VERANDA ROOF THE ROAD DUST ON THE MATTING UNDER THE WINDOW THE VINE TWIGS IN THAT QUARE MADE SKIRT NEVER WORN BY DAY 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_4446 HE ALSO BRINGS UPON HIMSELF THE SUFFERINGS WHICH HIS VICES PRODUCE THE DISHONEST MAN LIKEWISE GARNERS HIS OWN SUFFERING AND HAPPINESS IT IS PLEASING TO HUMAN VANITY TO BELIEVE THAT ONE SUFFERS BECAUSE OF ONE'S VIRTUE 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_4447 FOR WEAKNESS CANNOT PERSIST IN A POWER EVOLVING UNIVERSE A MAN SHOULD CONCEIVE OF A LEGITIMATE PURPOSE IN HIS HEART AND SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH IT HE SHOULD MAKE THIS PURPOSE THE CENTRALIZING POINT OF HIS THOUGHTS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_4448 AND FIXES HIS MIND ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS PLANS AND THE STRENGTHENING OF HIS RESOLUTION AND SELF RELIANCE AND THE HIGHER HE LIFTS HIS THOUGHTS THE MORE MANLY UPRIGHT AND RIGHTEOUS HE BECOMES THE GREATER WILL BE HIS SUCCESS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_4449 WHICH ROSE LIKE A CLIFF ABOVE HIM A SMOOTH BARE WALL OF ROCK THAT HAD HALTED HIS CLIMB HALFWAY UP THE SCARP WAS A DARK HORIZONTAL LINE OF BUSHES SOMETHING LIKE A HEDGE APPARENTLY THERE WAS A LEDGE OR SHELF THERE AND HE DECIDED TO CLIMB UP TO IT BEFORE HE RETURNED HOME
